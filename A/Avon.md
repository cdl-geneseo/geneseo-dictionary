NN. Either the town of Avon, which borders Geneseo, or the road which Main Street turns into after the intersection of Court St. and North St. Either term identified roughly 30% of the time by participants surveyed. 

This entry was originally created by K. Mitchinson, 2006.

Comments:

Now the question is how do you pronounce it? I always said &quot;/ay/-von,&quot; but according to my Rochester friends, it's &quot;/ae/-von.&quot; Hm.

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

100% of students have heard of this, but 50% pronounce it &quot;ah-von&quot; and 50% pronounce it &quot;ay-von&quot;. This word is relevant but still is debated. (Hastings, A-F, 2023)

This entry shows the intersection of phonology and regional variation–both coming together in Geneseo, where there is still no &quot;koinezation&quot; for pronouncing this place-name.
