Noun: The class required after getting in trouble for alcohol related incidents; &quot;Sorry guys I can't go to lunch today I have to go to Alc 101.&quot; 71% of people surveyed knew this term.J.Boselli, 2012: 25% of those surveyed were familiar with and could identify the term, with others confused by the context, instead construing &quot;Alc 101&quot; as a basic liquor, consumed typically by first-year students, e.g., Keystone beer. Not marked as obsolete, as alcohol-related incidents are still current.
