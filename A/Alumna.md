Comments:

I wonder, if alumna and alumnus were placed side-by-side, those surveyed would be able to differentiate the genders associated with each word. An interesting idea for future surveyors.

We actually did have them together, and survey respondents indicated to us that they thought we should separate them.

We should note that the plural of &quot;alumna&quot; is &quot;alumnae.&quot; In the traditional, male-tilted Latin forms, &quot;alumni&quot; refers either to a group of male graduates or to a mixed group of male and female graduates.

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
