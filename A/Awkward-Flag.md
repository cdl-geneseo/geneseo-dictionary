# Awkward Flag

Created by  Zachary Arthur, last modified by  Unknown User (kec3) on Nov 29, 2010

(NN): imaginary flag a person waves when experiencing an embarrassing situation. (F06)

KChapman, 2010:  This term may be obsolete at Geneseo.  Nobody I interviewed seemed to know this term.

This entry was originally created by K. Simmington, 2006.

Comments:

Only one person surveyed knew this term, and it referred to the definition posted. However, everyone else was not familiar with it, and did not use it. (Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

42.8% of those surveyed knew this term, 28.5% had heard of it but were not completely sure what it meant, and the other 28.5% did not know it at all, thus indicating that the word is decreasing in relevance at Geneseo (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

No responses indicated total familiarity with the phrase. Only 19% had heard it, though they could not define it, and 81% had never heard the phrase before (Anderson A-F 2020)
