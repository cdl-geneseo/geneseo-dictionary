Bibliographies and Study Guides : Art Department (lack of)

Created by  Unknown User (ms61) on May 08, 2015

The department that held the Art Major; Geneseo's lack of funding made them get rid of the visual art major, but the Art Department is still in Brodie Hall.

Comments:

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
