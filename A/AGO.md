NN. the Alpha Kappa Phi sorority, currently located at 26 Wadsworth Street. When surveyed on paper, participants were able to recognize this term 80% of the time. However, when surveyed on video, only 60% identified this, because the term was confused with &quot;Eggo&quot; brand waffles.

Comments:

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
