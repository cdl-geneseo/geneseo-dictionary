Noun - National Theatre Honor Society9% of people surveyed were familiar with this term

Comments:

With only 9% return on this one, we might want to designate this as a specialized term–probably only used by a small subset of Geneseo students, i.e., those involved with theater or closely connected to theater students.

37.5% of those surveyed knew this word, while 62.5% had heard of it but were not completely sure of what it means, thus indicating that it is probably a word still used by only a subset of Geneseo students, as Dr. Drake noted a few years ago above (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
