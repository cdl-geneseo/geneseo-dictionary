n. Pronunciation: Amer. / ə-diː-iː1. Acronym form of Alpha Delta Epsilon, a local Greek sorority, with a house on Livingston St. Colors are purple and white. “You can spot a sister of ADE by the colors of her letters.”K. Andryshak, 2012

Comments:

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
