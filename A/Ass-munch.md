According to the surveys that have been completed thus far, 29.4% of the students who took the survey are familiar with this term, and 70.6% of students are unfamiliar with this term. Of the students who were familiar with this term defined it as the original 2006 definition of the term. According to the surveys taken thus far, 5.9% of students use this word as a Geneseo college student. It can be determined then, that this word is not specific to Geneseo life, based on current results. (Birkby, A-F, 2012)

12.5% of those surveyed knew this word while 87.5% said they heard of it but were not completely sure what it means, thus indicating that it is still relevant in Geneseo, but most likely being used less than it was at the time this entry was made (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
