100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

100% of students asked knew the meaning of this word, but the accent used to say the word varied from Long Island to Boston, indicating that the word is relevant but the origin is debated. (Hastings, A-F, 2023)
