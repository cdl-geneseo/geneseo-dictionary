Add/drop: Noun- Period of time during which students can add or remove courses from their class schedules. &quot;I'll have to wait until add/drop to see if I can overload my credits.&quot; 100% of survey population was familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008.

Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 100% of the students who have taken the survey are familiar with this term, giving a similar (if not exact) definition of the original 2008 term. 100% of students in the survery use this word as a Geneseo college student. One specific surveyor adds to the original definition as: &quot;...a trial period which allows disillusioned freshmen to cry softly to themselves&quot;.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

100% of the students that were surveyed were familiar with this term, thus it is still relevant. (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
