# Atypical

Created by  Unknown User (ms61), last modified on May 08, 2015

Doesn't really stand for/represent/define one specific group of people.

Comments:

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

&quot;Atypical&quot; is now a word that may be shorthand for someone who is neurologically &quot;atypical,&quot; i.e., someone on the autism spectrum.
