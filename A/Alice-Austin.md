Noun – The main theatre in Brodie Hall where stage productions take place73% of those surveyed were familiar with this term

Comments:

100% of those that I surveyed did not know what this word meant. While this could indicate that the word is obsolete, it could also suggest that the group I surveyed was not diverse enough (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
