# XOXO

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 02, 2008

(phrase) Traditionally means &quot;hugs and kisses.&quot; Somewhat generalized to bidding farewell. Popularized by the TV show &quot;Gossip Girls,&quot; which ends every episode with &quot;XOXO Gossip Girl.&quot; 

Comments:

A term still in frequent use today. Of the people surveyed, all of them had heard of the word and a majority of them had used it. (Fuller, S and U, 2019)
