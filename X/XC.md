(noun) abbreviation for Cross Country, similar to &quot;LAX&quot; as an abbreviation for Lacrosse. Geneseo has a large, talented and prominent Track &amp; Cross Country team, often seen across campus wearing or carrying gear with &quot;XC&quot; on it. Being aware that is stands for a school affiliated sports team and not a Greek Organization is an important part of recognizing student identity.Carver Kozlowski, S-Z, 2019.

Comments:

50% of students who were surveyed have heard of this word and could define it. 50% of students have not heard of this word, thus it is still relevant (Corbett, S-Z, 2025).
