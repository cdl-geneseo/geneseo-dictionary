N. refers to an alcoholic beverage consisting of Jägermeister and Red Bull Energy Drink.  It has become a popular interjection following a YouTube video in which a disreputable character discusses ordering several Jägerbombs in quick succession.  It is usually repeated several times, while the speaker points with two fingers to several different locations, in imitation of the character in the video.  Alternative spelling might have &quot;a&quot; for &quot;ä&quot;. Example: &quot;I'll have a Jagerbomb and a beer.&quot;Not specific to Geneseo.As of 2012, 90% of students surveyed know this word. 0% believe it is of local origins.(Endress, G-M, 2012)
