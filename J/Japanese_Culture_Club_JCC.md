# Japanese Culture Club (JCC)

Created by  Unknown User (adb10), last modified on Apr 28, 2015

(noun) The Japanese Culture Club (JCC) was originally founded as &quot;Japanese Cooking Club,&quot; catering to those interested in Japanese cuisine and for the international Japanese students that could not eat Japanese food on a regular basis in Geneseo.As the club grew, they have expanded our goals and became a cultural club. JCC's goals are to provide the campus community of Geneseo with activities and entertainment reflecting Japanese culture, for a better understanding of Japanese culture.In 2005, they ventured and held the first cultural dinner show Japan Knight. They have increased their events on campus in the past few years and they are planning to increase them in the coming years! (http://www.geneseo.edu/~japan/about.html)As of 2015, 75% of the students heard the word, and 18.75% believe it is locally specific. (Bonetto, G-M, 2015)
