1) v. To engage in sexual intercourse, synonymous with “tap that”ex. “That guy is hot; I’d hit that.”2) v. to smoke something, especially a jointex. “I am not going to hit that joint; I don't smoke pot.”As of 2012, 100% of students surveyed know this word. 0% believe it is of local origins.(Flynn, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

Many respondents noted that the first definition of this phrase is only ever used in the conditional mood (ex. &quot;I would hit that,&quot; but never &quot;I will hit that&quot; or &quot;I have hit that.&quot;)
