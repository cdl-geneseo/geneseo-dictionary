Humans vs. Zombies n. a cos-play game, similar to tag, in which the weapon-carrying Humans try to avoid being caught by Zombies, marked by a bandana on their heads or arms.“Those kids are playing Humans vs. Zombies on the College Green.”100% of those surveyed have heard of this game and 100% believe it is of local origins.As of 2012, 95% of students surveyed know this word. 40% believe it is of local origins.(Endress, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

Although Humans vs. Zombies is unknown to most Geneseo students before they attend the college, leading them to perceive it to be of local origin, the game was first invented in Goucher College in Maryland. Its most common setting is college campuses.
