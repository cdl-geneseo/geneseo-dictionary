Created by  Unknown User (met6), last modified by  Unknown User (jcf10) on Nov 18, 2012

n.  Someone from a rural farming area; Geneseo students from Long Island frequently use this term to describe localsex. &quot;Oh my god, look at that townie. He's such a hick.&quot;Talbot, E-H, 2008 As of 2012, 100% of students surveyed know this word. 0% believe it is of local origin.(Flynn, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

Though this is by no means a Geneseo-specific term, it carries unique implications within the Geneseo college environment. Because the student body has such a high percentage of students from New York City and its close suburbs, especially Long Island, many students self-identify as somewhat culturally divided by their &quot;upstate&quot; or &quot;downstate&quot; origins. &quot;Hick&quot; is a frequent marker of that division, used by downstate students to derogate the culture of their upstate peers, especially the region immediately around Geneseo.
