Comments:

When relating to the interjection and the meaning of Herp being a slow-witted behavior I think it is important to note that it also can be referred to as  &quot;Herp a derp&quot;. I've included the Urban Dictionary link as well (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Herp-a-derp) that also states this. (LRumfola, S-Z 2012)
