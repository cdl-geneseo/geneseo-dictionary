n. A woman's breastsSource: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1999 - Kocher- 2006Â Of those surveyed in 2008, 85.0% recognized the word, and 0% learned the word in Geneseo.Talbot, 2008As of 2012, 97.5% of students surveyed know this word. 0% believe it is of local origins.(Flynn, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

I don't think this word truly qualifies as Genseo/College slang since there is a resteraunt chain of the name, and so many people outsie this group are familiar with the word.
