Created by  Unknown User (aof1) on Apr 27, 2015

written as &quot;#top25mostdangerous&quot;A study by StartClass listed SUNY Geneseo on their top 25 list of most dangerous schools. Geneseo students reference the school's ranking, often sarcastically.e.g. &quot;Someone didn't hold the door open for me #top25mostdangerous&quot;100% of Geneseo students surveyed knew this phrase. Out of those surveyed, 100% believe that it is specific to Geneseo.(Fox, G-M, 2015) In a survey, 89% of students did not know of this term. 11% of the students who completed the survey knew this term. 100% of the students who filled out the survey claimed that this term did not originate from Geneseo.
