# Hypocrisy

Created by  Bianca Volpe on May 07, 2022

n. To go against something that someone says or believes; When you say one thing but do another; To contradict oneself&quot;That is just pure hypocrisy.&quot; Based on survey result, 100% of students could define the word; 100% believe the word isn't specific to Geneseo. (B. Volpe, 2022)

Comments:

The word is really not even specific to a college environment. People have been calling out hypocrites for millennia.
