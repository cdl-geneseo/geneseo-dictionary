1. (adj.) (abbrv.) Used by History of the English Language students to express that a word is &quot;not obsolete&quot;. &quot;How about the word 'nasty'?&quot; &quot;Nobs&quot;. A. Moak 2010Obsolete as of 2015 (Toran, N-R, 2015).

Comments:

I am under the impression that this word was used exclusively by the Fall 2010 History of the English Language class, since (to my knowledge) its usage hasn't carried over into the Fall 2012 HotEL class, unless other groups have started using this term. So my guess is that this word should be marked obsolete. (Montelli, N-R, 2012.)
