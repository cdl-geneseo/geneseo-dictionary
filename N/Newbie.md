Newbie

(n.) A person who has recently started a new job, joined a new club, etc. "All of the work wasn't finished, so we'll just blame the newbie." A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=newbie ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Bates.

--2) A play-off of the word "noob"; Newbie is generally thought of as a friendlier term, indicating someone who is inexperienced but nonetheless willing to commit his or herself to learning

Comments:

An extant variant spelling is &quot;noobie&quot;, and in computer science registers, the same term might appear as &quot;noob&quot; or &quot;n00b&quot;, a contraction of &quot;newbie.&quot; KKirkman, 24Nov08
