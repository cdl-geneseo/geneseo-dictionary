NORML(nrml): (n.) National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; I joined NORML, but I forgot where my membership card is. Source: Geneseo Dictionary of English 2001. As it refers to a national organization, this entry is not Geneseo specific. Bates. (Obsolete, 2012)(McNiffe, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Based on survey results, this word is still obsolete (E Short, N-R, 2019).Â
