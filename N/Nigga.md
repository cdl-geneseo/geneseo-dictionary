Nigga

(n.) Friend or acquaintance. &quot;Lend me the CD. C'mon, you're my nigga.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2001. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nigga ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Bates.

Comments:

Has anyone discussed the politics of this locution--i.e., should it be proprietary for the African American community and otherwise considered derogatory usage for those outside the group?
