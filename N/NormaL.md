NormaL(n.) Annual Geneseo publication that parodies the Lamron; &quot;The normaL is normally not very funny.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2001. Bates. (Obsolete, 2012)(McNiffe, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Although listed as obsolete, 75% of students tested in interviews associated the term with the correct Geneseo-based definition. (Foley, N-R, 2015)

Based on survey results, this word is still obsolete (E Short, N-R, 2019).Â

A subsequent History of the English Language class should revisit this word. The NormaL is still a regular publication at Geneseo.
