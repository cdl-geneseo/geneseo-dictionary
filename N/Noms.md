(n.) A reference to food or snacks.JoyceÂ ex) &quot;Let's go grab some noms&quot; (Toran, N-R, 2015).

Comments:

I am curious about how many students here at Geneseo recognize or use this word. And whether or not it is of Geneseo origin. I would tend to think so because I have not heard anyone outside of Geneseo use this term when talking about food.
