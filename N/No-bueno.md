# No bueno

Created by  Unknown User (baj2) on Nov 20, 2012

(adj.) Spanish for &quot;not good.&quot; Bad.

Comments:

It is interesting to note that although this phrase is Spanish, it was used alongside English in examples given for its usage by students. ex) &quot;That test was no bueno. I think I failed it.&quot; (Toran, N-R, 2015).
