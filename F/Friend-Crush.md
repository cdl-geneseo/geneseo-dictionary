Friend Crush: noun refers to a person with whom one would like to be non-sexual friends, or the accompanying feeling in reference to the same person.

&quot;I have the biggest friend crush on this girl in my Chem Lab!&quot;

30% of people surveyed knew the terms

(Caitlin Klein)

Comments:

In 2012, less than one half of the people we surveyed claimed to be familiar with this term. Of those who claimed familiarity with this term, only half provided a definition similar to the definition provided in the Dictionary of Geneseo English. The remaining half believe that &quot;friend crush&quot; designates a friend in whom an individual has a romantic/sexual interest. The particular iteration of &quot;friend crush&quot; found in the Dictionary of Geneseo English seems to be in decline.Â
