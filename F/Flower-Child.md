According to the survey, 90% of participants are familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. However, this word is not used frequently in Geneseo student vocabulary. Due to students not finding a need to replace the word &quot;hippy&quot; with this term, it is really not used in present day. (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
