50% of those surveyed are not familiar with this word. Of the people who can define the word, almost all of them agree that the definition is &quot;flop down on soft surface to produce a light thud.&quot; This indicates that the word is not yet obsolete and that the definition has not changed for those who are familiar with the word (Smith, A-F, 2022).
