# Fugly

Created by  Unknown User (crk4), last modified by  Unknown User (jmb53) on Nov 20, 2012

Adjective Blend of fucking ugly, said to be euphemistic, allowing meaning to be conveyed in the presence of parents and other elders; &quot;Look at that guy. I thought he was cute from far away but he's not. He's ''fugly''.&quot;Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1995 - Kocher86% of students surveyed knew this word, and out of these, 16% first heard this word while at Geneseo. I would thus conclude that this word did not originate to Geneseo, nor is it restricted to Geneseo slang.(Klein, E-H, 2008)J.Boselli, 2012: Some participants felt the term was specific to the 2004 film Mean Girls. See &quot;clueless.&quot;   

Comments:

90% identified this correctly, yet none claimed it was Geneseo specific. (A-J 2012)

100% of those surveyed could identify this term. This term is not Geneseo specific. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)

Of the people surveyed 80% knew this term and could define it, 6.7% heard it but could not define it and 13.3% did not know this term, thus this term is relevent (jmg52, A-F, 2025).
