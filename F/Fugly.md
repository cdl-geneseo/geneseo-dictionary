Adjective Blend of fucking ugly, said to be euphemistic, allowing meaning to be conveyed in the presence of parents and other elders; &quot;Look at that guy. I thought he was cute from far away but he's not. He's ''fugly''.&quot;Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1995 - Kocher86% of students surveyed knew this word, and out of these, 16% first heard this word while at Geneseo. I would thus conclude that this word did not originate to Geneseo, nor is it restricted to Geneseo slang.(Klein, E-H, 2008)J.Boselli, 2012: Some participants felt the term was specific to the 2004 film Mean Girls. See &quot;clueless.&quot;   

Comments:

90% identified this correctly, yet none claimed it was Geneseo specific. (A-J 2012)

100% of those surveyed could identify this term. This term is not Geneseo specific. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)
