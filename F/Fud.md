# Fud

Created by  Unknown User (crk4), last modified on Dec 02, 2008

Noun' Spring 1998, 

1. Campus food, compared to real food; &quot;I'm starving; I need ''fud''.&quot; or &quot;They only serve ''fud'' until 6:30 at RJ!&quot; Centralization of vowel in food 

2. Also used as an interjection; &quot;''Fud'' &quot;Let's go to the dining hall! It's time to eat!&quot; Possible though unlikely connection with acronym FUD: fear, uncertainity, and doubt. (This might describe a campus dining experience.)

7% of students surveyed knew this word, and 0% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo.I would therefore conclude that this word is not well-known, and of those who do know the word, they did not learn it at Geneseo.

(Klein, E-H, 2008)

Comments:

100% of those surveyed were unfamiliar with this word, indicating that it is obsolete. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)
