It does occurr to me that there are &quot;fingermen&quot; in V for Vendetta, their job is to finger or point out possible threats to national security, perhaps it derives from that, though I still have never heard anyone use the term in this sense.

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define the word based on the Geneseo Wiki Dictionary's meaning; indicating that the word is obsolete based on the given definition (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
