Comments:

100% of those surveyed were familiar with and could define the term, likely due to the hall's relative novelty on campus and the heavy publicity that accompanied its opening. 2012

100% of those surveyed could identify this term. This term is Geneseo specific. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)

60.9% of the people our group surveyed defined this term. 44.9% of these people believe the definition is &quot;the name of a former on campus dining option located in the Union.&quot; Hence, the 2012 definition should be changed, as the Fusion dining option no longer exists (Smith, A-F, 2022).
