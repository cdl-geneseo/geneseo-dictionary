''Adjective'' Cool; &quot;I usually don't like orange and purple together, but that looks kind of ''funky''.&quot;

86%% of students surveyed knew this word, and 3% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo. This word is not original to Geneseo, nor even to college campuses.

Comments:

80% of the participants could identify this term. 20% had heard this term but were uncertain of its meaning. This word is not Geneseo specific. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)
