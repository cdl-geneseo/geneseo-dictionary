68% of students surveyed knew this word, and 7% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo. This word is not original to Geneseo, nor to college campuses. I would propose that &quot;funnel&quot; is a word that is found more prevalently among younger people, but the knowledge of the word is by no means restricted to this group.
