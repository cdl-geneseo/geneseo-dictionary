Feddy's

-Feddy's is a combination of two words Fast + Eddy's, coming to represent a shorter way of saying Fast Eddy's the campus store below Letchworth Dining Hall. Many students come here to get something quick to eat like a sub, some soup, or to get together with friends to meet up for ice cream.

Comments:

I find it interesting that several people commented when surveyed that they had heard of Feddy's but they thought it was just something that their friends had come up with, not a word widely understood on campus (and it is widely understood given survey results and random in-person testing).

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
