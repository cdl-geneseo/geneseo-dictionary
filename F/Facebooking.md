100% of people surveyed knew this term

(Klein, E-H, 2008)

Comments:

In 2012, more than 95% of the people that we surveyed were familiar with the term &quot;face booking&quot; and provided a definition similar to the one found in the Dictionary of Geneseo English. None of the respondents claimed that &quot;facebooking&quot; is a term exclusive to Geneseo.Â
