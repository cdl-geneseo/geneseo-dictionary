Results: This is a word that is new to the dictionary and was not tested. It is our guess that most students know of this day or event.

Comments:

In 2012, less than 1/4 of the people surveyed claimed to have heard this word before and could approximate its meaning. Although this word was not tested in the past, it seems unlikely that its popularity has grown since its contribution to the Dictionary of Geneseo English.Â
