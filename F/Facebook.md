n.A social media website where people can connect to share messages, photos, and videos.&quot;You should add me on facebook.&quot; K. Andryshak, 2012 Historically (Within Geneseo Dictionary project): Facebook: verb to look up someone on Facebook, the social networking website, in order to obtain information about them without said person knowing. Past Tense: Facebooked.&quot;I am going to Facebook him when I get home from the party.&quot;100% of people surveyed knew this word(Klein, E-H, 2008)

Comments:

I disagree that this is slang, given that it's the proper name of a website. It may have originally been included because it is specifically college, but it has expanded beyond that now as my mother has a Facebook account.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
