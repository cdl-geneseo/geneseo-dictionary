# Fives

Created by  Unknown User (jfw3), last modified on Sep 09, 2008

n. A practice used, most often when there are more people present than the number of acceptable seats, to retain one's seat when a phone call or bathroom stop is in order. The much more time-efficient shorthand for saying &quot;I reserve this seat for the next five minutes.&quot;

-JThompson-2006

Comments:

when initially surveyed my friend Laura said that she did not know the word &quot;fives&quot;, but that's because Laura doesn't think well out of context, in fact context doesn't always help, she uses the word all the time, I have witnesses. I have not heard this use of Fives outside Geneseo, my friends at home just say &quot;don't take my seat&quot; when they get out of it. &quot;Fives&quot; was introduced to me by Gamers, though I'm not clear where exactly it originated.

I agree with the statement above, I also had never heard &quot;fives&quot; until I came to Geneseo and it was used in the context &quot;I call fives&quot;, usually I would just hear or use &quot;save my spot&quot;. (LRumfola, S-Z 2012)

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
