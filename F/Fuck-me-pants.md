Comments:

I haven't heard this phrase, or &quot;fuck-me-red&quot; but I have heard &quot;fuck-me-(boots, heels)&quot; In context, I could identify basically any accessory or quality prefaced with &quot;fuck-me&quot; as something particularly provocative (perhaps evoking the image of a prostitute or other, ahem, sexually inviting or promiscuous woman) worn by a girl. Maybe the best way to discuss this phrase is as one possible addition to the prefix &quot;fuck-me.&quot;
