Friend: verb to request the status of &quot;friend&quot; with someone on Facebook

&quot;I am going to friend the new kid in the dorm down the hall&quot;

90% of people surveyed knew this term

(Klein, E-H, 2008)

Comments:

While the word is definitely college slang, it is also spreading beyond college because of the pervasiveness of Facebook, anyone can get an account, and so they in turn learn the lingo.

In our surveys most simply identified it as a person with whom you are intimately connected, with varying degrees of closeness. The association with Facebook is, I think, declining.

100% of those surveyed were familiar with this definition for the term contextually. However, most people would identify it as its dictionary definition as opposed to being associated with Facebook.  This term is not Geneseo specific. (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)
