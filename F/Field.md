Bibliographies and Study Guides : Field

Created by  Mia Gennaro on May 03, 2023

(noun) 1. In nature that can be used to describe an area of grass that is normally open, Ex. &quot;Look at those animals roaming around the field.&quot; 2. (noun) can be used to describe an area of study that an individual focuses on, Ex. &quot;She is working really hard in school right now, however, she needs to focus on a field to study.&quot; (Gennaro, A-F, 2023)

Comments:

According to the survey, 73% of participants are familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. This word is not used as frequently in Geneseo students vocabulary. When talking about school many people use the word &quot;major&quot; instead of field of study. Also, when describing nature, many people say &quot;look at that view&quot;, instead of &quot;look at the field&quot;, therefore its commonality has decreased overtime (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
