Noun Clip of frozen yogurt; &quot;Can you save me a seat? I am going to get some vanilla ''fro-yo''.&quot; Results: 68% of those surveyed knew this word, but 50% of these people did not learn this word at Geneseo. Conclusion: This word has moderate usage, and is not local to Geneseo. 

Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1999 - Kocher

Only 11% of students surveyed knew this term, and 0% of students learned this term while at Geneseo. I would therefore conclude that this word is not used much.

(Klein, E-H, 2008)

Comments:

80% of those had not heard this term. 20% were familiar with this definition. Most people would use &quot;Fro-yo&quot; as opposed to &quot;Fro-ya&quot;. Could this be a typo? (H. Ali, A-F, 2019)
