According to the survey, 100% of participants are familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. This word is used frequently in Geneseo students vocabulary due to how many students go out on the weekend to the frats. Many people who do belong to an organization form friend groups based on how they socialize at certain events with members of frats. (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
