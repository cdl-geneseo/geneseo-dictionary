n. Tagline for the presidential campaign of controversial rapper Kanye West. Often shouted out zealously by youth who are too irresponsible to develop their own political opinions.As of 2020, 76% of students surveyed were familiar with this word. Of those surveyed, 97% believe it originated elsewhere. (Kane 2020)

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants knew this word and could define it. It has little relevance in 2022, most likely due to the passing of the 2020 election. (G.Moulton, G-M, 2022)
