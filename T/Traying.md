Comments:

About 90% of those surveyed correctly identified this term. This word is probably only in use as related to when the activity is carried out by students. There is an entry for this term on urban dictionary (found here http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=traying) so it is probably not Geneseo-specific. (EReck, S-Z, 2102)
