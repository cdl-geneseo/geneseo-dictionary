# Tits Magee

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified by  Unknown User (amb51) on Apr 29, 2015

(noun) refers to a girl who chose to wear a low-cut/revealing shirt.&quot;Look at Tits Magee over there...is that a toddler's shirt?&quot;While this definition was generally well accepted amongst my surveyed population, (17/32 familiar) 10 out of the 17 who were familiar with the definition more commonly refer to it as &quot;Tits Mcgee&quot; and have stated that it is not typically used in conversational speech.

Comments:

About 65% of those we surveyed recognized the correct definition of this term. There in an urban dictionary entry for this phrase (found here http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tits+magee) so it is probably not Geneseo-specific. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
