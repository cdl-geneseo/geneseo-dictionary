Tard: (noun) insult; clipping from the word retard.

Source: Revised Dictionary of Geneseo English 1999 Mishra. Obs. 

Comments:

It appears that this term is not wholly obsolete. Although in both Geneseo-specific and Geneseo-non-specific terms it is certainly not politically correct nor generally accepted or condoned in society, it is not realistic to consider it out-of-use, along with it's derivative, &quot;retard.&quot; (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
