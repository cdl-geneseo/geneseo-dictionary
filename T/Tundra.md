About 30% of those surveyed recognized the correct definition of this word. Responses varied asÂ  to the specific location on the Geneseo campus that can be considered &quot;the tundra.&quot; (EReck, S-Z, 2012)

Almost 80% of respondents answered using this word &quot;never&quot; or &quot;rarely.&quot; Only two responses reported daily use. Together, these indicate that it is obsolete. (H. Heckman, S-Z, 2022).
