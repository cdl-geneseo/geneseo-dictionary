# Tree

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 02, 2008

(noun) Oak tree in quad surrounded by Sturges, Blake, Welles, and Erwin and painted by different fraternities and sororities.

2008: More commonly known as &quot;the painted tree;&quot; known to be painted by all different organizations, not only Greek ones.

&quot;Even though it changes all the time, I've never actually seen the tree in the process of being painted. I'm starting to think it's the work of elves.&quot;
