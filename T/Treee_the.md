Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 01, 2008

(noun) Refers to the broken tree branch that was followed around Geneseo during a blackout in September 2008. Chants of &quot;Follow the treee!&quot; could be heard across campus.

&quot;Forget the wind, I couldn't sleep because of all the treee followers last night.&quot; 

Comments:

Does anyone now at Geneseo even know what this means? At this point, it's been seven years.
