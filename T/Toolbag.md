(noun) Someone acting like such a tool that he goes beyond that label...he is now a toolbag.

&quot;Quit acting like such a toolbag, no one wants to hear about how much you bench pressed today.&quot; 

Comments:

&quot;Toolbag&quot; is uncommon with 55% of respondents never having heard it. It may become obsolete in a few years. (H. Heckman, S-Z, 2022)
