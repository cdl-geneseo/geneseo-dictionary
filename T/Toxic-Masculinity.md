(noun) - A narrow cultural concept that expects men to behave in certain ways to represent manliness, such as repressing emotions and using violence instead of conversation to avoid looking &quot;weak&quot;. Often teaches men habits that are harmful rather than helpful to them, not allowing them to behave in ways that they would like to out of fear that they will be seen less manly.(Fazio, Q-T, 2020)
