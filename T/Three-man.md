(noun) Drinking game with dice. Rules include: 6 and 4, everyone drinks; doubles, pass the dice; 7 pass dice to left; 11 pass the dice to the right (last one standing wins).

2008: Although only recognized by a small number of those surveyed, is still a term found on many websites featuring drinking games.

&quot;That game of three-man was intense, I was starting to think it would never end.&quot;
