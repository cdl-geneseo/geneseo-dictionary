Comments:

According to the surveys, 86% of participants knew this term and 14% did not know this term. The use of this term is likely more common among college students who are part of the LGBTQ+ community, but it should be known that it's possible that more students are familiar with this term and may use it in conversations related to gender identity and healthcare. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)
