# Transition or Transitioning

Created by  Kayla Stewart on May 04, 2023

(noun,verb)  1. The process of switching from living as one gender to another. 2. The process of going through medical and/or social changes to match one's gender expression and physical appearance.Example: &quot;After years of struggling with gender dysphoria, Sarah decided to start transitioning with the support of her friends and family.&quot; (Stewart, S-Z, 2023) 

Comments:

According to the surveys, 100% of participants knew this term and understood it. Given the growing awareness and acceptance of transgender and non-binary identities in society, it's likely that the term &quot;transitioning/transition&quot; is commonly used on campus, particularly among students who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)
