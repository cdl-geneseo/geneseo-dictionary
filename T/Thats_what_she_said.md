Comments:

The entirety of this phrase is still heard quite often, but in the ever-conquering age of technology the phrase has also become an acronym for easy online usage. &quot;TWSS&quot; has come full circle, as internet oddities are prone to do. It began as the full phrase, was shortened for typing purposes, and now resurfaces - as an acronym - on the tongues of students.Furthermore, the phrase has become tired. When heard it elicits more of a groan than a laugh and its usage in conversation is mostly an annoyance.The phrase is not obsolete, but it is (hopefully) on its way.RMyers, S-Z, 2012
