(noun) Affirmative comment for when someone is &quot;right on&quot;; in agreement with a statement.

&quot;The only thing keeping me from going crazy and curling up in a ball right now is knowing I get to go home in two weeks. ... True story.&quot;

Comments:

Still commonly used.  This phrase was popularized by the TV show &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; where the character Barney Stinson uses this phrase after telling an obviously fake story that usually involves himself or historical figures that are morphed into a &quot;Bro&quot; version.  For example, he tells a story about &quot;Saint Desperacius&quot; to justify his &quot;Desperation Day&quot; that is the day before Valentine's Day. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z Group, 2012)
