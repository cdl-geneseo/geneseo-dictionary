Taking one for the team: (verb) hooking up with someone (sometimes due to drunkenness) that you normally would not hook up with if &quot;the team&quot; hadn't needed you to do it.

Comments:

This phrase is recognizable but I'm not sure if it still in common usage.  Due to the popularity of Jersey Shore the new form of this phrase may be &quot;Jumping on a Grenade&quot; as that is a similar phrase that the people on the show use. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z Group, 2012)

This word isn't necessarily restricted to just the definition listed here either. It can also mean: (verb) To do something that one might not be eager to do but is for the best of a group of classmates or friends. It can refer to a group project, doing chores, or anything generally disliked. (M. Turner 2015)
