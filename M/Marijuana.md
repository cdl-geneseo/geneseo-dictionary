# Marijuana

Created by  Unknown User (wlf1), last modified by  Unknown User (msc5) on Nov 19, 2012

n. Common name for Cannabis sativa, a plant containing the psychoactive chemical THC.  THC has a myriad of effects, among them spacial and temporal distortion, sedation, and intense hunger. As of 2012, 98% knew the word and 0% believed it to be of local origin.(Craft, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

This is such a common word–and not even a slang word, but a standard word in American English–that it probably should not be in future Geneseo dictionaries. By contrast, a slang term for marijuana, particularly one that seems Geneseo-specific or at least specific to the register of American college students, would more likely warrant inclusion in the dictionary.
