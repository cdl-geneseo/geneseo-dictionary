n. Of the same origin as &quot;major wood&quot; above.   A penile erection experienced upon waking up.&quot;Of course; everyone's already in the kitchen downstairs when I walk down with morning wood.  Fantastic.&quot;As of 2012, 100% knew the word and 0% believed it to be of local origin.(Craft, G-M, 2012)
