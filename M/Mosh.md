1. n. A group of dancers throwing themselves into each other, often in response to rock music; &quot;Look at that mosh pit, someone is going to get hurt&quot;2. v. To dance in a group by violently slamming one's body against other similar minded dancers. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 2006, GoodspeedÂ The most frequent collocation is &quot;mosh pit&quot;.As of 2012, 98% knew both word definitions and 0% believed either to be of local origin.(Craft, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

This term is probably typical to college student vernacular in general, not Geneseo in specific, given the social currency music concert attendance and reference is currently accorded by the 18-25 year-old age group. (Craft, G-M, 2012)
