Comments:

62.5% of people surveyed still agree with this definition. 28.1% of people do not agree. 9.4% of people had never heard this word before. The relevance on campus was measured on a 1-5 scale. The results were greatly varied. 25% of people surveyed ranked it a 1 (not relevant at all). 19.4% of people gave it a 4 (pretty relevant), and 12.5 % gave it a five. Although this word is still known and used, its use and relevance seems to be fading.
