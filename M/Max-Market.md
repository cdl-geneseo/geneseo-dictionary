(noun) Max Market is a &quot;fun, playful, and unexpected&quot; on-campus food shop located inside Letchorth Dining Complex, on the North side of campus. It opened during the Fall semester of 2014, and students can get prepared foods or quick service dishes such as burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches. It also sells quick snack items such as yogurts or chips. It is an easy place to go to and it has a dining room next to it that is convenient and lovely.  As of 2015, 91.34% of the students have heard that word, and 86.7% believe it is locally specific. (Bonetto, G-M, 2015)
