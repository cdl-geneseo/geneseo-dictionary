# Club Milne

Created by  Unknown User (tjc13), last modified by  Unknown User (kec3) on Nov 29, 2010

noun- a nickname for Milne Library used by students who spend a lot of time there in an effort to make the experience of spending a lot of time in Milne appear more fun than it is.

KChapman, 2010:  I was not able to find anyone who knew this term, though the situation it describes is very common, so that several people were able to guess the meaning.

This entry originally created by T Cardot, 2008.

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not recognize nor were able to define this; indicating that it is obsolete(Jordyn Costello, A-F, 2019).
