This entry originally created by K Simmington, 2006.

Comments:

Approximately 20% of those surveyed could define it.   Chestnut street was unknown by approximately 20% of those surveyed.  The recognition and usage of this word seems to remain consistent with the results of the survey in 2006 (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
