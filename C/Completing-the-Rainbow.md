Comments:

The original survey results showed that 0% of participants knew what this term meant. However, none of the participants were members of a fraternity or sorority. In order to test the accuracy of our results, we asked a few sorority members. 100% of them were familiar with it. This would indicate that this phrase is popular amongst Greek Life, but less known if one is not associated with Greek Life. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
