This entry originally created by K Tousey and D McGiverson, 2006.

Comments:

More students would perhaps be familiar with the meaning &quot;to challenge or confront sb., esp. in public; to rebuke&quot;- e.g. &quot;He called his professor out for using a derogatory term.&quot;  This sense is extant, but is perhaps more commonly used in older registers. KKirkman, 24Nov08

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: 50% of participants were able to correctly define this term. Out of that 50%, 80% of them were a part of Greek Life. This term is relevant for those in Greek Life, however irrelevant for those who are not.
