CAS Slave (NN): 70% of people surveyed identified it as a person who works for Campus Auxiliary Services.

This entry originally created by K Tousey and D McGiverson, 2006.

Comments:

According to my group's survey thus far, about 42% of the population surveyed are familiar with this term, and 100% of those familiar with the term use the original 2006 definition to define the term. About 67% of those familiar with the term believe the term applies specifically to Geneseo college life. 33% believe the term is used at other schools, and therefore cannot be applied specifically to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: This terme was identified/understood by participants after being told the definition, however this term is not in use and is obsolete.
