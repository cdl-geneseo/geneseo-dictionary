Comments:

I find that this is more frequently referred to as &quot;Captain&quot; rather than &quot;Captain's&quot; because it is called &quot;Captain Morgan,&quot; not &quot;Captain's Morgan.&quot; (B. Joyce, 2012)

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: This term was not identified by participants. This may be for reasons pointed out by B. Joyce.Â
