Comments:

In Fall of 2012, 2/3 of the people interviewed expressed familiarity with the term crusty and defined it in terms consistent with the 2006 definition. No one that we interviewed believed that crusty had a special Geneseo usage.

100% of those surveyed were familiar with this word. This word is not Geneseo specific. (Ali, A-F, 2019)

M. Dombroski, A-F, 2023: 100% of students were able to identify this word, however the definition has changed in referring to another person, an example being &quot;this girl is crusty&quot;, meaning someone is gross or dirty.
