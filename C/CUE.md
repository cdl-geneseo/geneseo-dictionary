Comments:

According to my group's survery thus far, about 24% of students are familiar with this word, and 40% of those familiar with the term use the original definition. 60% of those familiar with the term defined the term as &quot;the white ball in pool&quot;.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

100% of those surveyed were unfamiliar with this terminology. It should be noted that none of those surveyed were College Union Employees. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
