Comments:

In 2012, approximately 2/3 of the people that we surveyed were familiar with the definition of &quot;civil war&quot; as a type of drinking game. None of the people who defined &quot;civil war&quot; as a type of drinking game thought that it was a term specific to Geneseo.This usage of &quot;civil war&quot; seems to be in decline.

Based on survey results, 80% of participants defined the word as a militaristic battle that was fought in history, but not as a drinking game.Â  This definition seems to be obsolete (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
