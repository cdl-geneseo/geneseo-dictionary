Comments:

100% of those surveyed identified this term as the second definition (2008). Crocs are associated with Meme/Vine culture and are often worn in an ironic fashion. There was a Vine (social media platform) where a young man walks up to a person wearing crocs and points to the Crocs, saying &quot;What are those?&quot;. This word is not Geneseo Specific, but the connotation appears to have evolved. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
