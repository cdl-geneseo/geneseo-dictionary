# Campus Grind

Created by  Unknown User (tjc13), last modified on Oct 05, 2008

Campus Grind (NN): place on the second floor of the [[College Union]] (in front of the [[Corner Pocket]] and [[GUS]]) where students can buy coffee, tea, soft drinks, and grilled focaccia sandwiches, among other things. 90% of those surveyed defined the word.

This entry originally created by L Tiszenkel, 2006.

Comments:

Because the Campus Grind no longer exists, it is no longer used in this way, but instead was interpreted to have something to do with the habitual routine of doing schoolwork.(Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: The &quot;Campus Grind&quot; is no longer a location on campus, so this term is completely obsolete to participants surveyed.Â
