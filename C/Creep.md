Comments:

I tend to use &quot;creep&quot; as a noun in reference to a legitimately sketchy, unsavory character, in contrast to &quot;creeper&quot; which, to me, is considerably lighter and less insulting. For example, a creep is a guy who manipulates women, while a creeper is one who, perhaps, starts awkward conversations with you about your most recent Facebook status update.

Is this term exclusive to heterosexual relations? Why does the definition specify &quot;opposite sex?&quot;

This term is not exclusive to Heterosexual relations. In fact, no one that was surveyed identified the word in this way. All of those surveyed identified this term to mean &quot;someone acting in a way that was strange, weird, or off-putting or in a manner that made them uncomfortable. There is some sexual connotation to this, as in &quot;someone being pervy&quot;, however that is not the sole interpretation. This term may also be used jokingly amongst friend groups. Ex. &quot;I just stalked this guy's Facebook profile.&quot; &quot;You're such a creep.&quot;Â 100% of those identified this word, but with a different definition. This word is not Geneseo specific.
