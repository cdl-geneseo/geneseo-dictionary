Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 1998 Simmington Clusterfuck (NN): Unknown by any participants. Obsolete. (F06) Simmington, D. McGiveron

KChapman, 2010:  This word has apparently been revived and was very well known by everyone I interviewed.  Used to denote an especially awkward or large gathering in a tight space, as in the mass of people seen around the doors of a building when a large group tries to exit at once.

Comments:

All surveyed identified this word, although the 2010 definition was used unanimously. (A-J 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could recognize and define this word (Jordyn Costello, A-F, 2019).
