In 2012, more than 90% of the people we surveyed were familiar with this definition of &quot;chill pill,&quot; could understand its use in conversation, and used the phrase themselves in conversation. None of the individuals we surveyed believed that &quot;chill pill&quot; was a phrase exclusive to Geneseo.
