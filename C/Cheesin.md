Comments:

This word seems to have fallen out of popular use. The definition listed here was not recorded by any of the survey participants.(Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, the 2006 definition as nobody defined it as that.Â  But, 60% defined cheesin' as to mean smiling very big, which seems to be a more modern usage of the word (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
