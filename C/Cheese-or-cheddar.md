cheese or cheddar : refers to money Obs. S99

Thise entry originally created by K Tousey, 2006.

Comments:

Of those surveyed thus far, apparently only about 33% are familiar with this term. This may be a fluke in the system, as I am not sure why only 33% of a population surveyed knows that the term &quot;cheese&quot; means, as there are more than one term plausible. Actually, 75% of the 33% who are familiar with the term defined &quot;cheese&quot;: (noun) a dairy product; &quot;May I have some cheese and crackers with my meal, please?&quot;25% of the population use the original 2006 term, and the term is therefore NOT obs.0% of the population surveyed believe the word is specific to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define the word as the 2006 definition.  This definition is obsolete.  But, 40% of participants defined the word to be referring to dairy products (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
