Comments:

According to my group's surveys thus far, about 92% of those surveyed are familiar with this term, and 100% of those surveyed use the edited definition from 2008 ( to have a good physique, usually characteristic of a male's face or muscular/[[ripped]] abdominal muscles). 0% of those surveyed believe the word is specific to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)
