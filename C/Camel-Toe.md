Camel Toe: Noun- the visual that occurs when a woman's privates are split down the middle by a high riding seam. This separation creates a pronounced effect similar in look to the two-toed hoof of a camel. 97% of people surveyed were familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008

Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, about 76.5% of surveyors are familiar with this term, 100% of those familiar using the original 2008 definition. About 53% of surveyors use the term as Geneseo students, and 0% of students believe the term is Geneseo college specific.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)
