V. to show no feeling towards or remorse. Said sarcastically i.e. &quot;Did you study for your finals?&quot; &quot;Care about finals.&quot; 15% of those surveyed identified this term, most of whom associated it with the Geneseo Men's Soccer and Lacrosse teams.

Comments:

None of the people that we surveyed in 2012 expressed familiarity with the 2006 definition of &quot;care.&quot; This definition is obsolete.Interestingly, a relatively small subset of the people we surveyed defined &quot;care&quot; as &quot;Dasein's attitude toward the World.&quot; The presence of this Heideggerian definition of &quot;care&quot; might be explained by the fact that we did some of our surveying in Philosophy Club, during a semester when Dr. Soffer was teaching &quot;Phenomenology and Existentialism.&quot;
