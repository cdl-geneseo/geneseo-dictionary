Comments:

Defined by two participants as a variation of beer pong, involving a ring of cups, a ping-pong ball, and the goal being to get the ball into the center. Not sure where the original definition came from, the next class may render it obsolete? We were unable to collect sufficient data in regard to this word as many participants left the space blank.

Based on survey results, 80% of participants could not define the phrase; indicating that the word is moderately obsolete and not widely recognized by the Geneseo community (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
