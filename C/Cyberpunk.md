Comments:

The original use of this word is a descriptor for a specific genre of Science Fiction originated by William Gibson.  It is currently used in Goth culture to describe a certain type of Goth, specifically a &quot;Cyber&quot; Goth who's style reflects an image of what a Goth might look like in the future.  Usage in Geneseo may be limited to the original version due to the relative lack of Goths. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z Group, 2012)

100% of those surveyed identified the word as &quot;a specific genre of Science Fiction&quot; or &quot;Goth culture&quot;. No one identified this word as the original definition. This word is not Geneseo specific. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
