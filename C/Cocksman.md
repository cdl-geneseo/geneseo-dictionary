Created by  Unknown User (bli2), last modified on Sep 21, 2008

Cocksman (NN): guy who goes out to meet women and hook up. Definition of approximately 10% of those surveyed. (F06) (new word) Unknown by approximately 90% of those surveyed. (F06) Simmington

Comments:

In Fall of 2012, 3% of the people surveyed provided a definition consistent with the definition provided in Fall of 06.Approximately 10% believed that &quot;cocksman&quot; had some association with rowing. No one that we interviewed believed it to be a phrase unique to Geneseo.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not recognize nor define this word. Obsolete (Jordyn Costello, A-F, 2019).
