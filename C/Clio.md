Comments:

According to my group's survey thus far, 50% of surveyors are familiar with this term, and 100% of those familiar with this term use the original 2006 definition. Of the 50% of surveyors familiar with this term, 100% of them believe the term is specific to Geneseo college life. It is interesting though that only 50% of those surveyed are familiar with the term, especially since the sorority is the oldest on campus, and their house is located right across from the campus, in almost plain view of students who are on campus.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)
