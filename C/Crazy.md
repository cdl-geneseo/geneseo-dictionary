Comments:

In Fall of 2012, more than three quarters of the individuals we surveyed expressed familiarity with the term &quot;crazy&quot; and defined it in terms consistent with the 2006 definition. One quarter of the people who expressed familiarity with the word &quot;crazy&quot; provided an alternate definition: crazy as a synonym for &quot;good.&quot; No one surveyed thought that &quot;crazy&quot; had a usage unique to Geneseo.This entry should be updated.Â

100% of those surveyed were familiar with this term. This term is definitely not Geneseo specific. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
