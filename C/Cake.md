# Cake

Created by  Unknown User (kec3), last modified on Nov 29, 2010

KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  Adj. meaning &quot;nearly effortless&quot;, as in &quot;That paper was cake.&quot;  Gathered from interviews during the research for &quot;cream cheese&quot;, with the same meaning, which seems to have gone out of use.

Comments:

In 2012, more than 90% of the individuals we surveyed expressed familiarity with the word &quot;cake,&quot; but all of them defined it as the dessert. No one provided a definition similar to the one seen here. This definition of &quot;cake&quot; is obsolete.

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: 100% of participants surveyed defined this word as the dessert. This definition of term is obsolete.
