Definition of approximately 14% of those surveyed. (F06) Unknown by approximately 14% of those surveyed. J.Boselli, 2012: Though 47% of those surveyed could identify the term, the recent introduction of &quot;Chow Hound&quot; in the Geneseo lexicon has led to a new sense of the word, referring to either the Chow Hound truck itself or the food it produces.

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete and widely recognized by the Geneseo community (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
