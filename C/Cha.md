Comments:

This term seems to have been revived, but now carries the opposite meaning.  That is, &quot;Cha!&quot; is now a term of enthusiastic agreement, and used to mean &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;  Alternatively, the term is sometimes used sarcastically to imply that the speaker has made a too-obvious remark.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not define the word and it is now obsolete and not widely used by the Geneseo community (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
