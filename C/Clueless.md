AJ: Ignorant. Ultimately from late 1930s British RAF term. Geneseo usage undated. clueless (AJ) - No change Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 1998 Simmington Clueless (AJ): Not knowing what is going on, no idea what is up, dumb, confused ignorance (although not necessarily the bad ignorance), being unfamiliar, airy, having no clue. Definition of approximately 93% of those surveyed. (F06) Unknown by approximately 7% of those surveyed. (F06) Simmington, D. McGiveronJ.Boselli, 2012: Though 100% of those surveyed were familiar with and could identify the term, 50% of participants understood the adjective as a reference to the 1995 Amy Heckerling film Clueless, similar to how &quot;fugly&quot; was seen to be connected to the 2004 film Mean Girls.  

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not recognize nor were able to define this acronym; indicating that it is obsolete(Jordyn Costello, A-F, 2019).

Not clear why &quot;clueless&quot; is an acronym. It's not as if the letters c, l, u,e, l,e,s, and s stand for other words. Are you referring to the RAF?
