Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, about 35.3% of students are familiar with the word, 100% of those familiar using the original 2001 phrase. 100% of those familiar with the term feel that the term is specific to Geneseo college life, but interestingly, not all the students who are familiar with the word and coin it as a Geneseo college-specific phrase actually use the word as Geneseo students.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 20% of participants said the term sounded familiar, but could not define the word.  The remaining 80% did not recognize the word at all ; indicating that the word is moderately obsolete (J Costello, A-F, 2019).
