This entry originally created by K Tousey, 2006.

Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, about 11.8% of surveyors are familiar with this term, similar to the amount of students familiar with the term in 2006. 50% of those familiar with the term use the original 2006 definition. 50% of those who are familiar with the term use the term as Geneseo students, and feel it is specific to Geneseo life; however, it is important to keep in mind that out of the entire surveyed population, only 11.8% of students were actually familiar with this term.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)Â

I think this term may actually be more commonly referred to as &quot;Campus CASh&quot; (probably mostly used by CAS cashiers when ringing up a student's purchase) rather than simply just &quot;CAS-h&quot;, which might explain the low percentage of students who recognized the term.
