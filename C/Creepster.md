noun- a variation of creeper, a sketchy person who makes people uneasy

Comments:

Creeper has become so widespread so fast I find it hard to label a creeper as someone who is necessarily sketchy. I could label someone who is merely socially awkward and thus comes off as sketchy as a creeper. As I said in my comment on &quot;creep,&quot; creeper is a pretty light word.

100% of those surveyed identified this as a term they had never heard. All participants could deduct its meaning, but it was certainly not in popular use. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
