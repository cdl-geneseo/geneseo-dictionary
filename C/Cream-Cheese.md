/krim ciz/ AJ easy; painless; trouble-free; effortless; uncomplicated &quot;My boss pays me to horse around all day; my job is cream cheese.&quot; ''The Lamron Horoscopes'', February 1, 2001 p.9 Source: Geneseo Dictionary of English, Spring 2001. -Mitchinson

KChapman, 2010:Â  This term was not known by anyone I interviewed. It seems to have been replaced by the word &quot;Cake&quot;.

Comments:

0% of those surveyed knew this word. &quot;Cake&quot; is still used. &quot;Cream Cheese&quot; appears to be obsolete. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
