I usually hear this shortened to &quot;camwhore.&quot;

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: 100% of students were able to identify this term with the second and third definitions, however not the first. The first definition is obsolete, likely due to the emergence of camera phones since 2008.

M. Dombroski, A-F, 2023: 100% of students surveyed knew the definition as &quot;a person who must appear in photos&quot; and &quot; a person who is always taking photos&quot;, but the part about facebook seems to be obsolete as new forms of social media have emerged since 2008.
