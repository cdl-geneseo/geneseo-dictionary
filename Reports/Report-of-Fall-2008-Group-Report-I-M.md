Writing a dictionary is not an easy task. It is a consuming mission for professional lexicographers (see James Murray), let alone novice, time-starved and sleep deprived college students. Despite all this, even from the very first meeting out group was looking forward to investigating the complex linguistic landscape of SUNY Geneseo. Throughout this entire process, we kept in contact through e-mail, Facebook, and met face-to-face every two to three weeks, updating each other on our progress and discussing new methods and problems.

The methodology for our study comprised four main foci: the use of paper surveys, verbal surveys at parties or social events, the creation of a Facebook group, and a close reading of the Lamron.  The paper surveys were perhaps the most systematic tactic we used, and in terms of the creation of dictionaries, the one with the most successful precedent.  We found, however, that the rate of responses to these surveys was quite poor; most of the surveys were not returned, and many which were returned did not contribute much in the way of additional information.  While many of the proposed words were recognized, additional words synonymous with ones proposed were not offered in a significant way.  This also meant that the terms of the paper survey were largely dictated by our group, rather than representing a more &quot;grassroots&quot; response which would permit a better sample for a Geneseo dictionary. Perhaps a better method in such cases would be an Internet survey, sent out to a scientifically determined sample group of Geneseo students.  One might surmise that students are more likely to respond quickly to an e-mail than a paper survey.  An additional incentive might also have been an expeditious choice, to encourage more responses, but this group did not possess the means to put such an option into play.  The investigation of the Lamron, the SUNY Geneseo student newspaper, yielded more extensive results.  Here the method was essentially to closely read the articles, singling out terms identifiable slang or terms specific to Geneseo.  Many terms found related specifically to academics, sports, school clubs, and places or events on campus.  Generally, though, the areas of more prolific lexical production were avoided, due to the prevalent journalistic register.  Students contributing to the Lamron are less likely to use slang in general, and in particular slang terms which refer to illicit or questionable practices.  A possible source of error in such a survey, however, might have been a failure on the part of the reader to notice slang terms which are so commonly used as to escape notice as unusual or peculiar. 

The final area of investigation, which provided most of our results, was focused on parties, social events, and popular locations for student socialization, such as bars.  As the atmosphere was informal and social mores and rules of propriety were relaxed, the use of slang was much more pervasive than in any other context. The actions peripheral to such events, such as drinking, drug use, and sex, also guaranteed that these activities would receive a more extensive treatment in the lexical production of Geneseo students.  The method here was twofold.  The first was a passive approach: group members would listen in discretely to certain conversations, noting peculiar or unique words and finding their definitions if necessary.  This did attract some attention from students who were concerned their activities were being monitored, but these fears were promptly assuaged.  The second, more active, tactic, was to use vocabulary which we had identified as unique to Geneseo or the Geneseo college register in conversation, and if no reaction of surprised or confusion was observed, it could be reasonably inferred that not only the term, but also its definition, was known to those participating in the conversation.

The fruits of our labors are as follows.  We found 19 words that were entirely new to the dictionary: Jagerbomb, Jame-o, Jamseing, Jerk off, Jizz, Kap, Kegger, Krunk, Krunk Juice, Lucy, Mackdaddy, Marijuana, Mary Jane, MJ, McCainiac, Molly, Morning Wood, and Mouth-breather.  Words we either confirmed or discovered to be obsolete were: Jap on, Jism, Jock Jail, Jonser, KMS, Laxitudes, Lustman/Lustwoman, Mamba Jamba, Moment of Silence, Mung, and Mungus.  In some cases, we found that words that had been replaced, as in the case of &quot;jism,&quot; being more or less replaced with &quot;jizz.&quot;  Words that we found to have become archaic were: Kewl, Kwinky-Dink, Mariazza's, Morgue, Morgue Hours, Muddows, and Mudshark.  In a few interesting cases, we found that words no longer remembered by most of the student body were immediately recognized by recent alumni; these instances led us to classify words like &quot;Mariazza's,&quot; &quot;muddows,&quot; and &quot;morgue,&quot; as archaic rather than obsolete. For one unique case, &quot;jonesing,&quot; we decided to make a forth category, &quot;resurgent,&quot; for words that had been listed as archaic in the previous dictionary but which we found to now have become generally used. 

One of the more interesting phenomena in all of this was the discovery that our methodology tallied very closely with that of the Fall 2006 group in our letter category.  Many of the challenges they observed were the same as ones we had experienced, and their assessments and analyses were in many respects consistent with ours.  This demonstrates, at any rate, the common set of solutions which might be proposed to the challenge of creating a dialectal dictionary.  At the same time, however, it demonstrates that many of the sources of error or linguistic &quot;blind spots&quot; are also consistent.  It is our hope in noting such pitfalls that future groups might profit from any mistakes we might have made, and prudently avoid these errors in their research. 

In addition, we identified a few areas of especially high lexical production.  Sexuality, alcohol, and drugs garnered many of the terms added to the dictionary, a phenomenon which is extant in older editions as well.  This likely stems from the fact that such activities are a commonplace among Geneseo students.  At the same time, however, this finding reflects the fact that many of the actions involving alcohol, sex, and drugs are seen as illicit, taboo, or &quot;off-limits&quot;, which would predispose individuals to use slang terms, periphrastic language, and euphemisms to refer to them.  This is perhaps more the case with alcohol and drugs, which possess legal ramifications, whereas with sex, the social stigma attached to conspicuous sexuality is quite minimal on a college campus.  The amusement factor was also reported to be an important one at work in the creation of sexual vocabulary: that a term was especially creative or ribald would usually indicate that it persisted in the Geneseo lexis longer, or was more popular at a given point in time.  Geneseo-specific terms were also plentiful, with the majority referring to campus groups and activities.  Conspicuous among these were Greek organizations, which, owing to their somewhat insular status and the peculiar culture of fraternities and sororities, possess more extensive lexica.  Sports teams also were well represented, as were certain aspects of academics, such as terms derived from professors' names, specific courses, or majors.

As technology has progressed, one of the fields which has undoubtedly seen the most rapid growth is communications technology.  Owing to the wide dissemination of Instant Messaging, e-mail, and texting, a peculiar vocabulary has arisen in connection with these devices.  One of the most difficult phenomena to assess is the position of texting in a dictionary. As our interviews, surveys, and reading focused largely on the spoken vernacular of Geneseo, many of the terms one would find in text messages, IMs, and e-mails were absent.  This is due to the separation of the registers of spoken Geneseo English and rapid modern communication.  There were some early indications that the abbreviated speech popular in IMs is infiltrating into s spoken English.  For example, one subject at a bar observation was heard to remark &quot;LOL&quot; in response to a humorous comment, the IM abbreviation for &quot;laughing out loud&quot;. The subject, however, was reprimanded by her companions for the use of the term as a spoken lexical element.  This could indicate that the rise of such IM-speech will ultimately be suppressed.  Owing to this fact, and the paucity of instances of such words, we have elected not to include these in our dictionary entries.  We note this trend with interest in this report, however, and point out that it could very well be a major factor influencing the developing the peculiar brand of Geneseo English, and the wider English language. 

E-mail proved to be our surest method of group communication. Authority within the group was largely decentralized, with each group member agreeing to certain tasks based on their schedules, desires, and specific circumstances.  For example, the task of reviewing the Lamron was delegated to one group member as a specific task, while others created and administered surveys or verbal interviews.  As time progressed, however, it became clear that all group members had overlapping participation in the verbal interviews and in listening in on conversations.  Such tasks as e-mail surveys, Facebook groups, and Lamron-scanning might function more smoothly in the future if a portion of each were delegated to all the members of the group.  This is not to say, however, that the task was too onerous, but rather a recommendation of ways to increase efficiency.  It fell to the individual group members, then, to keep records of the words they had found, and their methodology in doing so. Meetings would then be held to update the group on overall progress.  Entries were not generally made during the earlier days of the semester, in hopes of being able to test the maximum number of words possible in a survey.  This meant, in consequence, that the task of entering words loomed large towards the end of the semester, a situation which should perhaps be rectified in later editions. Frequent e-mail communication, however, ensured that group members were appraised of each others' progress, and surprisingly there was little overlap in the occurrence of words between group members. 

In the end, this experience proved to be a very fun, informative, and at times, inebriating experience. We learned a bit about what it means to be a lexicographer, as well as had the unique opportunity to contribute to an experience that students will hopefully look back on far in Geneseo's future.
