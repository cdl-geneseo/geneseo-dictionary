Introduction

While superficially, dictionaries may seem like simple tools used to define and understand words, they can provide a great deal of insight on topics other than &quot;words.&quot;  They can provide insight into the language of an entire nation or a relatively small region.  In doing this, one could even wager that much of the culture of that particular group is also being represented.  In creating our section of the Dictionary of Geneseo English, this is what we tried to do.  More specifically, we believed that by testing old words and attempting to discover new ones, we could provide a unique snapshot of life in Geneseo.

Strategies

To tackle our section of the Geneseo Dictionary, letters e through h, we began by entering the words on the wiki.  To us, this was a vital first step because it would allow us to evaluate what information we had to work with and where we should proceed.  After loading our words, we realized that over the years, during the dictionary project as a whole, inconsistent data was retrieved.  Some groups commented on where the word was found, the gender and race of each participant, and the prevalence of the word.  Others simply provided a definition and what part of speech that particular word fell into.  As a result, one of our major goals was to gather consistent, updated data on each of our words.

To accomplish this, we began by splitting up the words equally among ourselves.  We then administered a uniform survey randomly throughout campus.  For a sample of the survey refer to Apendix B.  These surveys were distributed in dinning halls, campus gathering places such as the College Union, residence halls, and at establishments around the Geneseo campus.  Our goal in doing this was to obtain thorough, objective results for each of our assigned words.  Each word was surveyed by anywhere from twenty-five to fifty randomly selected people.  This was done to ensure that one group of the community would not be overrepresented in our results.  For instance, we attempted to survey upperclassman involved in Greek organizations as well as underclassman new to the campus.  Once each group member administered their surveys, we then compiled the results to create what we believe to be the most recent Geneseo dictionary for our section of words.

While our process was not flawless, it did seem to accomplish our goal effectively.  More specifically, by dividing up our words, we were able to survey a larger, more diverse segment of the student population.  Additionally, in dividing our entire section into segments, we found participants more willing to complete surveys.  Instead of inundating each participant with a survey of over fifty words, we found individuals much more likely to complete the questionnaire if it consisted of less than twenty words.  Furthermore, because participants were not overwhelmed, we theorized that they were willing to give more comprehensive answers.  This was true in that often times, participants would provide us with insight into such things as how frequently they used the word, whether or not they had heard others use it, and what kinds of clubs they were involved in on campus.  Because of this willingness to share information, we acquired helpful data that was not included in the survey.  Instead, it was volunteered.

Challenges

Despite the advantages to our approach there were imperfections.  To create a dictionary truly reflective of SUNY Geneseo, it would be necessary to survey all students, or at least in proportion to the rates found on campus.  More specifically, as of fall 2005, 59% of the full-time undergraduate student population was female, with males totaling 41%.  In terms of race, 79% of students were Caucasian, 2% African American, 1% Native American, 3% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and 8% unknown.  Consequently, to make our research more accurate, in theory it should've take into consideration these statistics.  This, however, was not the case.  Because we randomly selected students from various locations we attempted to achieve data reflective of Geneseo's diversity but, in reality, our participants were mainly Caucasian.

Another area of our research which had limitations related to our method of collecting new words.  Our approach was to ask participants for their input while also looking at the Lamron (Geneseo's student newspaper), watching GSTV, listening to The Revolution (Geneseo's independent radio station), and simply paying close attention to conversations among students.  This, however, proved more challenging than we originally anticipated.  While student productions like the Lamron and The Revolution were telling as to the kind of language Geneseo students typically employ, they were not very valuable in providing new words.  In retrospect, attending meetings of student groups might have been a more effective way of discovering new words.  For instance, those involved in the theatre program are aware of the word Brodie rat which is a frequenter of the building Brodie.

A similar case is presented with the word Herzmanite.  This refers to a student who is an avoid follower of Professor Herzman.  Because Professor Herzman is in the English department, one could speculate that English majors are much more likely to know the meaning of this word as opposed to a Biology student, for instance. In other words, anyone outside of the department may be clueless as to what the phrase might mean.  Consequently, from this we could speculate that other groups, teams, and even majors may have their own words.  Moreover, it is highly possible that, like Brodie rat and Herzmanite, these words would be unique to Geneseo.

Correspondingly, one of the largest challenges we faced not only as a group but arguably as a class was determining the distinction between words unique to Geneseo versus words unique to college life in general.  As a result, one could argue that there is significant overlap.  Certain words, however, such as Erwinhead, fly-day, and Greek Tree, did prove to be distinct to Geneseo.  While this was not the case for the majority of our words, we choose to include non-specific words anyway due to the entwined nature of Geneseo life and college in general.

Findings

Based on our research we did notice some general trends.  When a word appears to be Geneseo specific, it typically is not highly recognizable.  The term gaitering is a perfect example.  Because this verb is practiced solely by the fraternity Delta Kappa Tau of Geneseo, only its members are aware of the term.  Consequently, the word isn't used or even known by many but it is Geneseo specific.  Another example of this is Erwinhead.  In this case, Erwinhead is Geneseo specific.  Although it is not widely used, members of the Geneseo community are aware of its meaning and if not, they can successful theorize what it means.

Another trend that we noticed concerned the familiarity of words that relate to flighty, sexual acts.  More specifically, it seemed that males were more knowledgeable about these words than females.  Hook and reel is an example of this trend.  (See Appendix B for graphical representation.)  In this specific case, 56% of participants agreed with the definition provided.  Of that 56%, over 90% were males.  Similarly hook my totch produced similar results.  In this case, of the 63% participants that agreed with the definition, 81% were male.  While we are unable to offer a valid explanation for why this is true, we felt it was worth noting.

Conclusion

Overall, we believe that our method of gathering information was effective despite its limitations.  With any form of research, however, we feel that there will be restraints.  Regardless, our overall goal was to create an accurate picture of the language used by the SUNY Geneseo community and, in the process, shed light on Geneseo life in general.  While a dictionary might simply be a &quot;book of words,&quot; we believe it has the potential to be something much greater.
