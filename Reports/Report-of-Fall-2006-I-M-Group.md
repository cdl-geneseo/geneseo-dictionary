When we first started the project we had a general idea on how we would progress.  Each of us was enthused and idealistic as we worked to establish the Geneseo Wiki Dictionary, letters I-M.  For the past months we noticed how the gathering and creation of material for a dictionary is obtained and processed.  Our path was not the most productive, learning from mostly trial and error; we struggled through the obstacles and prevailed.

We began the project by creating weekly meetings that were held on Monday nights at 6.  We examined the previous lexicons and enjoyed reading some of the words.  We noticed some of the words were not exactly specific to Geneseo; however, we decided to leave them included believing that at one point they could have been.  We noticed some words were obviously specific to Geneseo, mostly places and sports teams, were not included on the list.  The Meadows was not on the list, nor were the Ice Knights and Knights.  We began to wonder what approach other teams had taken to the success of the project.

We added words of places, teams, and other Geneseo specific organizations that we could think of at the start of our first meeting.  We were only able to come up with ten new words to add to the Dictionary.  These words include: &quot;Ice Knights&quot;, &quot;ISF&quot;, &quot;jitt&quot;, &quot;junk (new definition)&quot;, &quot;Knights&quot;, &quot;Letch&quot;, &quot;Mariazza's&quot;, &quot;(The) Meadows&quot;, &quot;Milne&quot;, and &quot;MJ&quot;.  These words were not part of the 1998 Geneseo Dictionary.  We also discovered two new words that are documented on the movie we presented: &quot;Frosties&quot; and &quot;Chilly Climate.&quot;  With the exception of the previous two words, we added those words to our list of words to be surveyed.

We wondered how we were going to approach a large body of people with the information prevalent to our research.  We wondered how we were going to make the tests quick and easy, but more importantly how we were going to get both a random aspect to the survey and an accurate one.  One idea that Kris had was to administer a campus wide survey, via e-mail.  This was not a feasible idea.  We could not get permission to basically send out a spam e-mail, asking people to take a few moments and fill out our survey.  We tried again this time with a proposal on a smaller scale.  However, we still couldn't get the permission to our e-mail plan.

In attempt to reach a large body of people, the Facebook group &quot;Geneseo Dictionary Project&quot; was created.  It was an attempt to expose people to the Geneseo Wiki and acquire new words.  Seth was hoping that people would be influenced to create a discussion or post on the Wall.  However, only one phrase was recorded from it.  Cage Fucking - the act of fucking through a cage; its origin: during the premier of Lost, sawyer and Kate were locked in cages and it was said &quot;they're gonna cage fuck the shit out of each other.&quot;  This window did allow for Seth to be confronted face to face by people with new words and terms.  Frostie was among these terms.  A Frostie is a Freshman Hottie.  We learned from this that people are generally lazy and need upfront motivation in order to give accurate or, in this case, any results.

Jesse attempted to get in touch with the Lamron and try to get a small blurb about the Geneseo Dictionary Project in.  He was unable to get in touch with the right people.  It wasn't until we did the video project that we were able to talk to the Features Editor of the Lamron.  However, due to the lateness of this contact, it did not prove useful at all since it wasn't until December that we were in touch.  It is speculative on how our results would have differed if we would have gotten the blurb in.

We started thinking that listening to conversations would be a good way to compile a list of new words.  In attempt to make our data as vast as possible and cover as many different scenes as possible, we visited places on campus, found hot spots, and eves dropped.  This did not have the desired effect we were looking for.  There wasn't anything specific to Geneseo in their speeches besides that already presented on the Wiki.  We thought this would be a good time to start collaborating ideas for a paper survey.

Our next step was to create a survey similar to past surveys.  We concluded that our surveys needed to have a certain criteria that would allow for us to document the groups surveyed.  We reviewed past groups formats, and decided that ours would do what we wanted (see attachments).  The survey would give us precise results, help us to determine if a word if obsolete or archaic, and the body represented.  We had the people being surveyed to identify what year they were, their residency, and gender.  We the preceded to ask the surveyors to check the line if the word described was Familiar or Unfamiliar to them.  If the word was familiar we had them define the word.  At no point in time would we tell them what the word was during the actual taking of the survey, we would share the information after the survey was completed.  If they could simply identify the word and relate it somehow, it would be sufficient to our purposes and make the survey quick and easy.

The next step was to do a divide up all the words into groups of 12-15 words.  Each of us then took a group and completed a paper survey.  We all had an equal share in the collection of the data and did no less than thirty surveys each, we completed 200 surveys overall with a good spread of numbers.  We took these surveys all over campus and off campus.  Some places such as the Union, MJ, Letchworth, and Mia's were among the best places to get results.  The group didn't want to limit the collection of words to certain groups of people.  By limiting the selection we would lose a large body of students.  After we gathered our information we created the appendixes that are attached.

Following the paper surveying, we would document some of the words via video tape.  The words that we used were determined by their relativity to Geneseo.  We didn't want to use words that we knew they would know; instead we wanted to make this as comedic and fun as possible.  Words like the IB, Midnight Grind, and Legend of the Bear were among our favorites to ask.  After all, what self respecting Geneseo college student can resist talking about virgins, grinding, and drinking?  This documentation was our final attempt to bring together our project.  Originally it was to be presented during our final group presentation; we then thought that we should keep it with our results.  Although we didn't ask for the same formal information that the paper surveys asked, we used the video as proof that some words are still known, and fun to talk about even though sometimes they lead to awkwardness.

After the survey data was collected we compiled a list of archaic and obsolete words.  Words such as &quot;Kwinky-dink,&quot; &quot;jonsing,&quot; and &quot;JAP,&quot; were archaic.  The students knew what they meant, but did not use them in their everyday language.  Meanwhile words such as &quot;Jap on,&quot; &quot;jism,&quot; &quot;jonser,&quot; &quot;KMS,&quot; &quot;knob,&quot; &quot;late night,&quot; &quot;laxitudes,&quot; &quot;letchover,&quot; &quot;LM,&quot; &quot;LUG,&quot; &quot;lustman,&quot; &quot;lustwoman,&quot; &quot;mamba jamba,&quot; &quot;Midnight Grind,&quot; &quot;mung,&quot; and &quot;mungus,&quot; were obsolete.  No one knew the correct response; they made attempts to define it.  We assumed that these terms had become obsolete and should be labeled as so.

One thing that had bothered us was that some of the definitions we imputed into the Wiki had disappeared. We all checked the website to make sure that we had all the words put in, even now after we re-did them, there are words that have had their definitions removed.

This project, as we all agree, made us aware of the effort put into making a dictionary.  One thing that gave us a problem was the distribution of the surveys on a large scale, one that would guarantee accurate results.  Time and persistence allowed us to overcome the scaling issue.  The more time we put in, the more surveyors we had.  Other aspects worth mentioning again was the issue that our surveyors had places to be, so our surveys needed to accommodate for speed and efficiency.  With the division of the words among all of us, this allowed for 10-15 words per survey.  This took less than five minutes to finish.  We were able to reach satisfactory results with over 200 surveys taken.  We then focused the data from our surveys to the preceding appendixes to demonstrate the number of Geneseo students and non-students we surveyed their year at Geneseo, and whether they were male of female.  We also determined how many people knew the word against those who didn't and the percentage of the results.  Without these findings we would no be able to represent the validity of the surveys.

Overall, our group worked collectively for the duration for the project.  Our weekly meetings gave us insight on what needed to be accomplished per week.  We believe that our approach to the way we collected data was fully sufficient and our results were satisfactory.  Looking back we would have liked for our failed ideas to have worked better.  The widespread e-mail would have been beneficial.  We would have hoped to get some new words, or a response from a large base of individuals.  The Facebook idea could have worked better if there was more publicity behind it.  As for the Lamron, we just couldn't get in touch with the people we needed to until it was too late.  Our paper surveys were the backbone and really allowed us to get a good analysis on the dictionary words.  If we didn't have our weekly meetings none of these ideas would have taken any form.
