As we represent students across the three lower years (Freshman through Junior) as well as a variety of majors and extracurricular interests, it was an effective way to narrow down which words were extremely common and which were mostly unknown. When we concluded our initial informal survey of each other, we determined a lengthy list of words that the majority of the group did not recognize and decided to test these for recognition amongst the rest of the student body. We agreed that if every member of our group knew a word immediately upon seeing it that it would be worth it to not test it in consideration of keeping our surveys short enough that others would be willing to take them. After we compiled our list of words, we separated them into smaller groups of around 20-30 words each and assigned them to members of our group to survey.            Initially, all of our group members used Google Surveys to conduct their research. Google Surveys is a particularly helpful tool because it was easy to duplicate the format of the survey so we all had uniform surveys and because the program generates percentages, pie-charts, and other analytic information regarding the results for us. Having the survey based online was also useful because we were able to reach people that we may not have if we only surveyed people we encountered on campus. Each of us posted our surveys into our respective “Class of” pages on Facebook as well as our personal pages and asked people to take the survey and share it. This allowed us to get the survey into the view of everyone who is enrolled in our year at Geneseo. Besides the diversity of age-ranges, we are each involved in different clubs and organizations. Some of the groups that our members were able to send surveys to include a private violin lesson group, a Dungeons and Dragons Group, the co-ed Ultimate Frisbee team, Mock Trial team, and RLK. Each of these interest groups were asked to send the survey on to their own friends and each represent a wide range of ages, majors, and access to different slang lexicons.            After we received our responses for the surveys of more obscure words, we collaborated to think of new words to add to the dictionary. We wanted to have at least three new words for every letter in our range of the dictionary and succeeded in that goal and in some cases exceeding three new words. We ended up with around 20 new words and so decided to all survey all of them in order to get as much data as possible. Because of some problems with the online survey process that will be discussed later, we agreed to conduct this survey in person rather than online. Our members sat in the lobby of their residence halls, in the College Union, and passed out paper surveys in their classes. Since we were all testing the same words, we could rely on the diversity of our research group to account for diversity within our research subjects. Thus, although Onondaga is primarily Freshman housing and the students in a class are likely to be the same major or at least have the same interests, our research was still representative of a wide range of students thanks to our collective involvement in so many different things. We then counted our results by hand which some of our members really disliked and then entered them into an excel spreadsheet which we set to calculate sums and percentages of the data we collected indivdually.            Our members experienced mixed results when it came to the mode of conducting our surveys with some members preferring the online and others preferring the in-person interviews. Some liked that the surveys were online because it did not require them to go and talk to strangers or be forced to spend hours sitting in a location conducting the research in person. However, one problem with the online surveys was that we were limited in the number of responses we received. The student body is flooded with surveys from other students conducting research for Psychology, Communications, or any number of other classes at Geneseo. This has led to many online surveys that are posted to Facebook or emailed directly to list-serves to be deleted or just ignored. Consequently, although we were able to reach a large volume of people easily and quickly, most were not likely to fill out the survey unless they personally knew the member who sent it. We got more responses from the in-person interviews because people are harder to ignore than emails. Even though the in-person surveys were more time consuming and required more energy on the part of the member conducting the survey, everyone reported that most people were happy to complete the survey in person, although some students did complain about having to write their responses by hand.Another problem with our online surveys had to do with the nature of what we were asking of the research participants. Because we were testing words that we knew would be unfamiliar to many people, we should have included an “I don’t know any of these words” option in our survey. However, we did not realize at the outset that this would be a problem. Some of us realized once we started getting feedback from friends who reported very apologetically that they did not know any of the words and so closed the survey. We realize that this likely skewed some of our results since we were checking not only for recognition but also for obsoleteness. Google Surveys does not report how many people open the survey, only how many answers were submitted. Therefore, we had no way of knowing how many people saw the survey but did not know the words, so they were not counted in our total number of responses, affecting our percentages. Some of us edited our surveys and included the option, but it was after the survey was initially sent, meaning that we were not able to get responses from people who looked and closed the survey without the option. On a related note, many of the students who were taking the survey wanted to be helpful and had a notion of there being a “correct” answer. Thus, many guessed at definitions, marking their uncertainty by including a lot of question marks after. In many cases the definitions they provided were in fact a match with that in the dictionary but the fact that they were unsure is something that must be remembered when we consider the difference between recognition and use.Similarly, many of the words we were testing had a general nature or multiple meanings. This led to students marking that they knew a word, but when asked to provide a definition said something completely different from the definition provided on the Geneseo dictionary. This was not a complete disaster because many of the divergent definitions were known by wide numbers of people leading us to add the new definition to the entry. However, it did skew our numbers of recognition because our data was no longer comparable to the percentages already in the dictionary that referred to the same word with a different meaning. One great example of this is the word Lumpy. Our member was looking for the definition “a drink offered at the Vital Spot,” but the 75% of students that said they recognized the word provided the definition “bumpy or uneven.” Because lumpy is a word that has other meanings besides the specific slang usage, we determined that even though 75% of students said they knew the word, lumpy as slang is now obsolete. Another example is krunk juice, which is defined in the dictionary just as “alcohol” generally, but that the majority of students defined specifically as “alcoholic punch or jungle juice at a party.” In this case the definition narrowed to refer to something more specific, but the fact that it is still in wide usage is significant. In both of these cases, the word surveyed does exist in some form but in a way that diverges from the one reported in the dictionary.There were advantages and disadvantages to each of the modes of surveying we conducted besides the things already mentioned. Our members found the in-person survey to be time consuming and tedious especially in calculating the results by hand after the surveys were complete. However, one advantage of the in-person surveys was the immediate feedback from students taking the survey as well as the ability to have a conversation with the students being surveyed. For these reasons amongst others, we believe it may have been more beneficial to have surveyed our new words that would be more recognizable to students online and the more obscure words in person. If we had done this, students would have been able to tell us they did not recognize any of the words or could have asked questions about the definitions we were looking for. Overall, people did not seem content to see language as something so black and white as “I know it” or “I don’t know it” and would have preferred discussion, trying to supplement their answers with as much conjecture as they could fit into the text box. This leads us to conclude that although in-person interviews are more tedious and we may not be able to generate as many numbers as quickly and efficiently, there are definite benefits to talking about language usage rather than merely presenting a concise written survey that leaves little room for expression.Our second survey felt much more accurate for a few reasons. We were able to generate many more responses on our second survey than our first because we were all surveying the same words. When working with percentages, the more data you have the better, something we struggled with when conducting the online surveys. We wish there had been a better way to balance the need to research a large volume of words and the need to keep our survey brief so people would actually fill it out. Perhaps if there had been more time, we would have been able to break up the surveys more, but considering we already had trouble getting students to fill out two we are unsure how successful that would have been either. We were also able to judge more easily the difference between recognition and use during our in-person surveys. Because our second survey invited more discussion and interaction with participants, there was the space to include whether the word was something they had heard or something they use themselves. If we were to participate in this study again, this would definitely be a distinction that we focused on more whether that be by having more conversations or by adding a question asking about frequency of use.We found this study to be a very rewarding experience although sometimes overwhelming. The social aspect of language made it difficult to compile numerical data especially when that data is coming from so many sources. We were not able to find a very strong local voice of Geneseo in the slang we studied, instead encountering a lot of slang that is used across the country at other colleges and by people our ages. Interestingly, the terms that people marked as believing to have originated in Geneseo are the ones they did not know. Perhaps due to our involvement with people all over America on social media, most of the slang is not recognized as local unless it involves explicit mention of Geneseo, a club on campus, or a shop in the village. We believe it is important to keep doing this project as the years go on to see if a local voice returns more prominently like we can see in the past entries in the dictionary or if we are too connected to have many specialized slang terms at our college.This is probably the most thoughtful reflection I’ve seen on the advantages and disadvantages of research methods. You show that you can see problems with online surveys and have learned in the process how to improve them. Moreover, you have shown just how important it is to have an in-person component in research, even if this requires more work.Also, it’s fascinating to find that the same words have new definitions, and you should be commended both for discovering this and reflecting on this. Finding new definitions is as important as finding new words. This suggests that one of the main goals of the Dictionary project is to look not just for words but for MEANINGS that people circulate in communication at Geneseo.
