Introduction

Focusing on words beginning with letters N-S, our group assumed the task of updating the Dictionary of Geneseo English started by Dr. Alan Lutkus, and transferring it onto the online Geneseo Wiki.  Guided by the research and reports of past classes, we collected, compiled, and tested both previously researched words, as well as newly added entries.  The survey results from current SUNY Geneseo students determined the fates of each word, ruling them as valid or obsolete.  Our group also utilized urbandictionary.com to determine which words were likely not specific to Geneseo.  

Strategies for Data Collection

Immediately after receiving the assignment to execute a survey of the Fall 2006 SUNY Geneseo N-S Lexicon, we began our first round of data collection.  Group members generated college related words beginning with letters N-S from memory.  Inspecting previous dictionaries of the Geneseo Lexicon from 1996 and 2001 helped to inspire the recall of additional terms.   At our first meeting, our group determined a list of locations both on- and off-campus, as well as &quot;virtual&quot; locations, that could serve as resources for discovering terms used by current students on the SUNY Geneseo campus.  Locations included:  MacVittie Student Union, Milne Library, Geneseo bars, Main Street businesses and restaurants, academic buildings, facebook.com, myspace.com, instant messages, extracurricular activities, residence halls, dining facilities, fraternity/sorority members, current issues of The Lamron, and a Student Organization Exposition.  

For two weeks following our initial meeting, group members remained attuned to the vocabulary used by SUNY Geneseo students in Fall 2006 to add as many words to the updated Dictionary of Geneseo English as possible.  Each member was assigned one of the aforementioned locations around Geneseo from which to generate corresponding words.  For example, Natalie and Alfred both work at Mama Mia's Pizzeria on Main Street and listened for Geneseo English spoken by the customers.  As Resident Assistants on campus, Thaddeus and Kathryn were assigned to compile words frequently used by students living in the residence halls on campus.  Being the President of the Geneseo Environmental Organization, Stephen undertook the duty of discovering words common to the extracurricular activities held within the MacVittie Student Union.  

With a modernized list of Geneseo-generated expressions, along with pre-existing Geneseo English from past Dictionaries, our next group task was to decide on an appropriate format of determining the usage of each term.  Group members agreed that conducting a brief survey with random test samples of students would provide the best information on the current usage of each collected word.  As the Fall 2006 History of English Language groups were responsible for examining the validity of words included in previous dictionaries, our surveys were to include terms found in the 1986-1996 and 2001 Dictionaries of Geneseo English.  Having a total of around one hundred and ninety new and old words to assess, it was decided that each group member would be responsible for surveying twenty different people on their knowledge of the same forty (approximately) words included in the N-S word bank.  A master survey template was created that provided the opportunity to comment on the usage of twenty different terms and their respective definitions.  Smaller print was used to allow the respondents space on the survey for modifying or providing an alternate definition for a specific word.

Each survey inquired on the answering student's year at SUNY Geneseo, their hometown region (Long Island, Western NY, etc.), their sex and whether or not they were an international student.  We consulted princetonreview.com to rule that race or ethnic origin should not be a factor explored in our results, given that SUNY Geneseo is not considered a diverse campus.  When we distributed surveys, we did not specifically take the ethnicity of the participant into account.  Upon inserting their respective alphabetical list of forty or so words into the survey template, the group members began the process of asking students to assess the current usage of each term.

The process for each group member to follow when surveying students began with a brief introduction to the purpose of the project.  Surveyors then explained the significance of the &quot;Y,&quot; &quot;N,&quot; or &quot;O&quot; responses to each word.  The Geneseo student was told to circle &quot;Y&quot; for the word and corresponding definitions that they commonly use or hear on the SUNY Geneseo campus.  The letter &quot;N&quot; indicates that the student has never used or heard the word throughout their college experience at SUNY Geneseo.  To indicate that a word was once popularized but is no longer common, the letter &quot;O&quot; (for &quot;obsolete&quot;) was to be circled.  Surveyors also encouraged students to provide alternate definitions for words they felt could be used in more than one context and to underline specific parts of the provided definition that are familiar.  Group members stressed the importance of evaluating the use of each word specifically in relation to the SUNY Geneseo community.   By asking surveyed students to include their own definitions or comments on the word surveys, our group attempted to account for unknown definitions or flaws in our survey format.

The intention of surveying the SUNY Geneseo campus was to obtain as realistic a representation of the student vocabulary as possible.  To account for the proportion of males to females on the SUNY Geneseo campus, the number of surveys issued to members of each sex was in proportion to the campus ratio.  We felt this was needed due to possible differences in vocabulary, specifically slang, between genders.  Consulting the official SUNY Geneseo website, we determined the ratio of females to males to be three to two, and thus our surveys were issued in that proportion.  Specifically, of the twenty surveys each group member was responsible for, females completed twelve, and males completed eight.  Beyond our gender restrictions, our survey samples were chosen randomly.  Another specific component to the surveying of our terms was to consult the relatively small population of international students on campus.  As foreign students have probably learned the majority of their college-themed vocabulary while here at SUNY Geneseo, we concluded that their survey results would supplement our findings, establishing a &quot;control&quot; group of words that were purely of SUNY Geneseo origin.  

For three consecutive weeks, group members distributed surveys to random students across campus.  Locations such as Milne Library, MacVittie Student Union, academic buildings and residence halls provided easy access to test subjects.  The majority of vocabulary surveys were issued to students in highly populated areas of campus.  Several group members approached students attending the September Student Organization Exposition and gathered information on the surveyed vocabulary.  Thaddeus and Kathryn solicited students in completing surveys within their respective residence halls while Natalie and Alfred evaluated a number of students on and near Main Street.  Living in a residence hall that also houses three international students, Kathryn had access to international students.

After each set of words was evaluated by 20 different students each, the results of each group member were compiled.  An Excel worksheet organized the raw data, demonstrating the responses of males and females from SUNY Geneseo.  Every term was evaluated for its inclusion on the Urban Dictionary website.  The final stages of the data collection process determined the current validity of the terms as used by students studying at SUNY Geneseo in the Fall semester of 2006.  All tested words were included on the Wiki, along with definitions, pronunciations when needed, with referenced source dictionaries, and, when applicable, external links to similar entries at urbandictionary.com.

Results and discussion

After compiling our data, we had to decide on how to rule a word obsolete.  We decided that an obsolete word would meet at least one of two criteria: 1. Either the word has a tally of 4 or more for &quot;O&quot; (Obsolete), or 2. The word has a tally of 3 or less for yes.  Judging from the results we tallied, we felt that a tally of four or more for obsolete was enough to render a word obsolete.  While a minimum tally of four seems low, we felt it was an accurate benchmark.  Despite our instructions, we didn't feel that all survey participants had an understanding of obsolescence.  We received several surveys that didn't have a single &quot;obsolete&quot; selected.  The highest tally of obsolete we had for a single word was eleven.  Based on these criteria, we rendered 65 of our 191 words obsolete.  These words were labeled obsolete on the Wiki.

We found representing the campus gender ratio helped accurately establish words as currently used or obsolete.  Terms such as &quot;reemed&quot; were recognized by half the females surveyed, while seven of eight male survey-takers reported that they recognized the expression.  Conversely, &quot;Savvy&quot; was recognized by eleven of twelve women test-takers, but only two of eight men knew the word - had more men taken the survey, &quot;Savvy&quot; may have been found obsolete.

Our idea of using international students' responses as a control was unsuccessful.  After giving two     Spanish students the survey, our group's surveyor realized that the student knew general college terms, but not Geneseo-specific ones.  For example, she knew what &quot;quarters&quot; was from visiting fraternity houses, but didn't recognize the word &quot;Sturges.&quot;  She had already learned general college terms, and seemed to answer words as a generic, non-Geneseo college student would.  The idea of specifically surveying other international students after this realization was abandoned.

Despite our instructions for selecting &quot;Y&quot; for survey terms (meaning that a student had heard the entry used specifically at Geneseo), we believe many entered &quot;Y&quot; regardless of whether they heard the word used at or prior to their time at Geneseo.  However, checking entries against those on urbandictionary.com helped us identify words as not specific to Geneseo. 

At completion, our survey demographics revealed that 9% of survey takers were freshman, 28% sophomores, 31% juniors, and 32% seniors.  With the exception of a low percentage of freshman surveyed, the graduating class distribution of other survey takers was fairly evenly distributed.  This, actually, may have contributed to the accuracy of our results, since freshman have not been fully assimilated into the SUNY Geneseo community, and in turn the Geneseo vocabulary.  By region, 49% of those surveyed were from Western NY (Buffalo, Rochester, etc.), 20% from Central NY (Syracuse, upstate towns, etc.), 5% were from Eastern NY (Albany, etc.), and 24% were from Long Island and the NYC area.  2% were from other areas (e.g. international students).  We did not plan ahead to try and gather specific amounts of data from class year and location.  Ideally, we would have, but the process seemed too demanding.

Interestingly, many group members reported that students they surveyed were impressed by potential dictionary entries, and claimed that they planned to incorporate them into their vocabulary.  Group members did direct them to the Geneseo Wiki page, and doing so might have unintentionally skewed our results.  Perhaps in the future, exposure to the Wiki may have the effect of reviving previously obsolete words.

The majority of the words we found to be neither obsolete nor listed on urbandictionary.com typically referred to Geneseo locations, both on and off campus, or were fraternity/sorority related terms.  Of the 191 words we surveyed, we found 37 to be unique to the Geneseo word stock (or Genuinely Geneseo).
