Hannah Ali, Jarred Bloom, Jordyn Costello, Madyson Gillanders, Hannah Nicchi, John SerbalikEnglish 361-015/7/19Professor DrakeA-F Group Report Our words were A-F. We began our Dictionary project by splitting our words into seven sections with 52 words each. We first discussed our sections as a group, determining what words we were each familiar with and what we considered to be Geneseo-specific. This allowed us to predict what words would most likely fall into the category of “obsolete.” During our second meeting, we collectively brainstormed a list of 22 potential A-F words to add to the dictionary.After we divided our words up, we began to strategize. There were multiple ways in which our given words were studied. Perhaps one of the most efficient methods for determining the popularity of a given word was through the use of online surveys. The ability of students to engage in statistical reporting was made possible by technologies such as Google Forms and spreadsheets.For example, we each made spreadsheets with our individual list of words and shared the spreadsheets with one another in a group google folder so that everyone had access to all of the data and progress of the group. Next to each word was a drop menu with three options. The options next to each word differed, to some extent, for each of us in wording, but not in meaning. For example, one of us had “no idea,” “familiar,” and “can define word” as the options, while another had “don’t know it,” “heard of it but not 100% sure what it means,” and “know it.” Essentially, the three options for each of us were either that the person did not know the word at all, the person has heard of the word, but can not testify to what it means with full confidence, or the person has not only heard of the word but can also define it.  Here is an example of one of our spreadsheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vz1LJ95LXpGZmjqca4MYHH30Sy4OarYlfTsmu6Bs8Fg/edit?usp=sharing. Upon completion of our individual surveys, we added comments about their relevancy under each of our list of words. We decided to convert our results into percentages, and we added the percentages of the results under each word, while also adding whether these statistics render the word obsolete, still in use, or decreasing in relevancy. To survey the relevance of the potential new words we planned on adding to the dictionary, we created a Google survey and put the survey in the class of 2021 Facebook group, asking if people could take a couple of minutes out of their day to fill it out. We received 98 responses. The Google survey form provides a chart with percentages of the responses for each word, and this helped us to determine whether or not to add the word to the Dictionary. Once we were able to narrow down our list of words to be added to the dictionary, we split this list up among our group members and each person added two words and their respective definitions, while one of us only had to add one (given our odd number of members). Here is the link to the Google survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FNab_NyatveJpyfkXIer87y8D8ce2L5IjIVDYHapzzI/edit?usp=sharing.             While our individual survey methods were relatively the same, there were a few small differences. Some of us preferred in-person surveys, some relied solely on online surveys, and some of us employed a combination of both. In all of our approaches, we tried to gather a diverse range of people to provide more accurate results. A strong advantage our group had was our individual ties to Greek and social organizations. Being that the majority of us are in different Greek organizations, we were able to gather a variety of responses.Some of the problems we encountered while embarking on this project came about in its later stages. There was a mistake made in one of our postings which resulted in what Dr. Schacht called, “exploding the page.” Initially, we were uncertain as to whether or not we would need to rewrite all of the prior entries for A-F in order to remedy this problem. Luckily, we noticed that Dr. Schacht was listed as a Wiki Administrator and immediately made an appointment to see what could be done. Dr. Schacht was incredibly helpful to our group and helped us fix the error, providing us with a better understanding of the Wiki page, and aiding us in future troubleshooting.            In solving this first problem, we discovered another problem that had occurred as a result of a mistake made by a prior group. The dictionary is split into sections: A-D, E-H, I-L,etc.. We learned that a portion of the dictionary entries was in a different location from the words we had surveyed. This meant that we had to find a way to survey, analyze, and comment on the new updates in the timeframe of a weekend. Group members agreed to split the 62 additional words and survey/update them. This problem was resolved.Upon seeing the number of problems that have occurred in the posting of entries on the dictionary, it may be indicative of the need for a better understanding of the Wiki system by the entire class. The biggest problem that our group encountered was a result of a previous mistake made by past groups which shows that the way that each group understands the Dictionary is important to the experience and effectiveness of groups to come.            Upon the completion of this project, our group agreed on a few things that we wish we had known prior as well as some advice that we would give to future groups. We would also like to include our ideas regarding how we felt that we could have improved our project if we were to do this again. First and foremost, we all agreed that it would be advantageous for future classes to have a better understanding of the way that the Wiki works. Examples of this could be a demonstration on how to post entries, an educational session with Dr. Schacht, as well as listing Dr. Schacht as a resource if a group encounters any technical issues in their use of the Geneseo Wiki. This would be beneficial for not only this project, but also for our career as students. If we understand how the Geneseo Wiki works, students may be able to use it more effectively as a resource in their academic career. For instance, Dr. Schacht demonstrated Wiki’s ability to function as a personal portfolio.            As far as our strategy, we would have liked to include more options on our survey (Familiar, Never heard of it, Heard of it but not sure of the meaning, Never heard of it but could determine the definition through context,  Geneseo-specific, Not Geneseo-specific). This would allow for a better understanding of how words are used within the community, as well as the popularity of the words in question. This would mean implementing a longer online/in-person survey or a series of surveys. We also would have liked to survey more people; to expand our surveying methods. Some of these methods could include surveying other students from different schools (to determine what words are Geneseo-specific), surveying professors (to determine what words are known by different demographics/providing a better insight into generational differences in language), and adding a section for participants to add their own words that they believe should be on the dictionary. This would not require the participants to look at all of the dictionary entries, as this would be overwhelming. Rather, there would be a spot at the end of their survey to write-in their own ideas for slang words which they are using at the time of the survey. It would be up to the group to compare the suggested words to the Dictionary. Another possibility to consider for future groups is how to handle words which are obsolete. As the list expands, the workload placed on both the surveyors and the surveyed may not be cohesive to a good study. Perhaps we should consider not surveying words which have been obsolete for a certain number of dictionary updates.While examining SUNY Geneseo’s student population, it is inevitable for one to take note of the assortment of social groups. In many cases, students within these groups also participate in numerous other clubs or social organizations. However, many participants gravitate towards a specific demographic. Inherently, those drawn to these distinct demographics have unique experiences from those of another. Since each of our dictionary group members are involved in a different group on campus, it was vital for us to examine what was familiar and what was not among all of us. The dictionary project as a whole allowed each group member to get out of their comfort zone and expand their point of view. While exploring the unique dialect of this seemingly divided student population, we were able to come together as one to see how our vocabulary connects us. This report mirrors the dedication I see in your responses to older postings and your introduction of newly-found words. The combination of survey types, along with the scale of familiarity with words that you ask people to respond to, are both key to effective research. More important: the problems that you ran up against with the Wiki—something that the previous class did not experience or that they overlooked—raise some important suggestions for a future class. Having Dr Schacht give a presentation would be a very good idea, and as you point out, not just for the dictionary, but for other helpful uses of the Wiki in students’ careers here at Geneseo.
