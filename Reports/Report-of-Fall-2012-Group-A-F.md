Group A-F Final Report ENGL 361 Project Administrators: Kristen Andryshak and John Boselli Group Members: Kevin Allott, Clarisse Birkby, Jenna Cecchini, and Matthew CordellaTo begin our project, we met as a group and conducted a preliminary scan of the A-F words already on the Wiki, while discussing words that we were individually unfamiliar with. We designated one group member to begin an initial document containing any common words that were missing (typically proper nouns), as well as any words we felt had come into use in the years since the Dictionary was last updated (colloquialisms, cultural references). We then began asking friends on campus if they had any words they felt specific to their Geneseo life, and then added these to the collection we had already begun on Google Drive. With these planned additions in mind, we sorted out the distribution logistics.Prior to developing our survey methods, Google Drive was already instrumental in keeping open lines of communication, so that if a new word were to come to our attention, it could be added immediately to the existing list, and everyone’s documents would be simultaneously updated. Another benefit was that it kept our information well-organized and not spread among loose papers, which given our necessarily few and far between meeting times, was a legitimate concern.Given our group members’ campus involvement, each of us had a unique lexical perspective, e.g., involvement in fraternities/Greek life (John), the equestrian team (Clarisse),  Philosophy Department and Club (Matt), and Student Union/Starbucks (Kristen). To capitalize on the diverse range of organizations made available to us, we decided to divide the initial word list on the Wiki into twelve separate surveys through an arbitrary method of numbering, to avoid one person having all words beginning with the letter “a,” for example. The new words were then evenly distributed to the newly made surveys, and each group member was given two surveys to distribute as they saw fit, though most relied on Facebook. After first testing several websites that would host the survey for us and compile our data into charts (SurveyMonkey, KwikSurveys, and FreeOnlineSurveys), we decided that using the “form” option on Google Drive would give us the control over the surveys that was not possible through a third-party website. While tabulation would be tedious, this decision let us retain some sort of flexibility and freedom in our design that would not be found elsewhere.On Google Drive we were able to set each survey to an unlimited number of questions, decide the format of the questions and the method that participants would use to input their answers. The form would automatically take the answers provided and insert them into a spreadsheet, with all word choices listed as the column headings horizontally and the participants answers grouped vertically underneath. This allowed for efficient data analysis when modifying entries on the Wiki, adding new ones, commenting, and marking identifying obsolete words. The forms, when published, provided the developer with an unique URL, that each group member could distribute to their participants, who would then be directed to a dedicated survey page free of advertisements, account creation/login, and were assured of complete anonymity. Given that we could only necessarily control the convenience of the survey’s distribution and hosting environment, we welcome this streamlined interface.Thus, though we had once considered paper surveys, electronic surveys were agreed upon as a group as a means by which to hopefully ensuring a better turnout. Also, using Google Drive presented itself as a unique platform for examining the dominance of the internet among Geneseo students. There is a Google Drive application available for both the Android and iPhone/iPad, so accessibility was even less of an issue than previously thought. We chose an entirely web-based platform as an experiment, for we would be the first group to have done so in the history of the Dictionary of Geneseo English. As opposed to using some sort of Likert scale, we privileged accuracy of responses over uniformity. The survey was structured as follows:Preliminary Directions:For each question, please indicate:                          1) Are you familiar with this word? (yes/no)                         2) Can you define this word? (if yes- write short definition)                         3) Do you use this word as a Geneseo/college student?                          4) Is your usage of this word specific to Geneseo life? Questions (which appeared beside each word, as a reminder/prompt, above a fill-in box):                         1) Know this word?                         2) Define it?                         3) Do you use this word?                         4) Specific to Geneseo?(Links to two of the surveys can be found by clicking here: Geneseo English Survey 5 or Geneseo English Survey 11) There is little difference between “somewhat unfamiliar” and “unfamiliar” when discussing specific terms like “Carrot Run.” The trouble with Likert scales is that they have no sort of numerical basis; we cannot quantify familiarity with a word.  Therefore, by encouraging a response in the form of “Yes/No, I...this word before,” we learned much more about the status of our A-F words. Though the survey may have appeared imposing with its lengthy directions, in reality this ensured a high level of accuracy by making our expectations clear as possible.Our decision to format the survey by providing unlimited space with a large, paragraph text box allowed for conversational responses as well, allowing us to almost replicate face-to-face surveys and reactions by giving participants the opportunity to respond any way they wished. Had we insinuated that clipped, one word responses were preferred, we would have received far more of them than we actually did. To avoid potential response bias, e.g., an inflated answer given the context of a term’s context as “new,” we placed the new terms among the existing ones in the survey. By not splitting the survey we lessened the risk of respondents completing only the added words section. They may have thought contributing novel terms to the Geneseo Dictionary was a more pressing (and convenient) concern than deeming older ones obsolete.We students are denied access to many of the departmental/residence life Webmail List-Serve accounts, so we were forced to turn to more creative, less uniform sampling methods, and all group members did this in different ways; John posted his two surveys in his fraternity’s and the Geneseo Class of 2015’s Facebook groups, in addition to asking some of his fellow hall residents to complete the surveys, given that many transfer students are placed in his building; Kristen posted her surveys on her own Facebook wall, as well as in the Class of 2013’s Facebook group, ensuring both freshmen and seniors were specifically targeted, as well as specifically asking certain Starbucks co-workers to take her surveys; and Clarisse initially tried to use email to communicate with her intended group of recipients, and received no response. She then took to Facebook as well, creating an event linking to both her surveys and proceeded to invite all of her Geneseo friends to the event. This method was much more successful, and as a result, Matt also used this method, obtaining a significant number of  responses. Jenna and Kevin, however, encountered no difficulties in obtaining survey responses via email.  This is not to say that we did not encounter our fair share of miscommunication. Difficulties arose in supposedly slang uses of common words, like “clueless,” a term misinterpreted as a cultural reference to the 1995 film of the same name, or more problematically, proper nouns, which in the case of “Ella Cline Shear School of Education” and “Chow Hound,” are not inherently colloquial. Some of the responses for these terms read simply, “not slang,” without answering any of the four questions. Perhaps they felt that the Dictionary were reflective of Geneseo’s slang use and counterculture. Again, this was part of the mixed blessing of the open-ended text box, allowing users to voice their exact opinion, however helpful they believed their input to be.When familiarity percentages were less than 25%, as in the case of “embiggen” (13%), we convened to discuss the status of the term, namely the wording we would choose, settling on some variant of “growing obsolete” or “expected to diminish in use in future years.” Often in the dictionary we would mark those words with a note or comment for future classes that they may want test these words for complete obsolescence.Some words corresponding to Geneseo lore expected to be obsolete were not dying quietly. One interesting anecdote to note is the instance of “Follow the Tree,” a term associated with a Fall 2008 campus-wide power outage that culminated in a student march led by one boy holding a fallen tree branch. Unexpectedly, this term is still in use four years later, and is recognized by 60% of the population who took the survey on which this word appeared.Oftentimes we encountered decisions that were not as clear-cut, where words such as “can’t-get-it-upagous” saw the obsolescence of one sense of the word and the emergence of another; during 2008, the term was a colloquial name for the curved tree in the center of Sturges Quad (also known as the “Seuss Spruce”), but by the time of our survey, it was understood more as a slang term for erectile dysfunction, alcohol-induced (“whiskey dick”) or otherwise.For future groups, organization-specific terms like “ADE” (Alpha Delta Epsilon), “big-big-big,” and “chapter,” ought to be watched. Depending on the growth or decline of Greek life on campus, student familiarity will wax or wane. The status of “Big-big-big” is an important lesson in word endangerment, because although only 20% were familiar with it and only and 13% could define it, the term is not endangered because it is absolutely alive in Greek groups. We learned that usage context must be considered in making status judgments.In total, among the hundreds of students sampled, we received 173 responses across the twelve surveys. The highest recorded number of responses on an individual survey was twenty-eight, while the lowest was four. The latter was likely due to the distribution procedure, which involved being sent via email. The ease of the survey, however, cannot be disputed, for even when a non-effective method of distribution was used, some response was still received. The large gap between email and Facebook responses shows that while a web-based platform may be the most successful with the current generation, it is most dependent on the method of communication used in regard to the internet.As a group, we felt that our experiment using Google as the host both our project notes, group meetings, and surveys was successful. We were able to receive almost four times as many responses as some surveys in 2010 (see Group Report N-R, total number, Geneseo Wiki), which led us to believe that with some modifications to avoid clarity issues, the Google platform (and other websites) has become the best method of reaching the current generation of Geneseo students.
