Ilona Fishkin, Emily Grossman Final Report G-M  As we learned in the presentations about the Webster Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, compiling an accurate and concise lexicon is an arduous and painstakingly long task which requires the involvement of many years of labor and dedication. When we first saw the task assigned to us, we were a bit intimidated by the few months we had to assess the terms already present in the Dictionary of Geneseo English. At first, we were unsure if our contribution would be significant, and we were hesitant abouthesitated surveying people on a large scale with such a vast array of different terms both familiar and unfamiliar to us. We faced our apprehensions head on by deciding to tackle all of the terms already in the dictionary in order to assess their prevalence and usage in Geneseo speech.  As opposed to including only words we were unfamiliar with into the survey, we chose to include the entire scope of G-M in order to ensure that our opinion was not a variable in determining a word's usage among students on campus. Good control thereIn order to make sure that every word was covered in our surveys we decided to interview students in small groups, face-to-face, to maintain accuracy while engaging the interviewees in a personal atmosphere. Although this required surveys to be time consuming, the sacrifice was worth it, as we realized that many inconsistencies between our own personal opinions about words and the data collected were present.  In order to save time during interviews, we created an Excel spreadsheet which catalogued every word in the dictionary that we were responsible for as well as any new terms that we had already brainstormed. The first thing we did was copy the existing terms from the Wiki and paste them into the spreadsheet as a hyperlink. This feature provided us with easy access to unknown definitions during our surveys because if there was a word that we were unsure of we could easily click the hyperlink for instant access to its definition in the Wiki. During the survey process, this saved us a lot of time that could have been wasted unnecessarily navigating through the dictionary. Additionally, the spreadsheet was split into eight more columns, such as &quot;local?&quot; &quot;total surveyed&quot; and &quot;percent know,&quot; which allowed for easy input of data and immediate calculation of percentages. Furthermore, the fact that we could email the spreadsheet to each other, with any newly added data and terms, helped us to remain up-to date with each other's progress. This sounds like an efficient sort of method because, for one thing, a spreadsheet would allow you to compare a lot of data at once just by looking at the screen. We discovered that our approach was particularly useful as a method to obtain new words precisely because it required going through the entire list of included terms. After the survey process, we found that those that we interviewed were more than willing to contribute words that they themselves use on a regular basis and that they noticed were absent from the dictionary. In fact, more often than not, we were provided with several words without even having to prompt the interviewee beforehand. As a result, we ended up with a total of 52 new words to add to the dictionary. These words are as diverse as the sample of student voices we surveyed and range from &quot;grundle&quot; to &quot;middies&quot; to &quot;mac salad&quot;. &quot;Mac salad&quot; was interesting in particular because although everyone surveyed knew the definition, the only people who believed it was of local origins, or had first heard the word used in the Geneseo area, were from Long Island suggesting that the word is absent from speech in that region of New York. The Long Islanders said that at home, the phrase &quot;macaroni salad&quot; is used instead. We did find that because of the rapidly enlarging list of new terms coming in every interview, we wanted to make sure that each new word was exposed to as many people as possible before it was entered into the Wiki. For this reason, we waited as long we could before posting our findings. This is an interesting particular example. Although we were able to contribute a heavy amount of new words to the dictionary, we found that it was difficult to record data from a large number of people due to the time consuming survey process. Timing our first couple of interviews we found that the process took 10 minutes to do, on average, and not many strangers were willing to sacrifice that much of their time. It was also impossible to interview people on the go and people who were in situations that limited attention spans, such as parties or bars. To find a group of people willing to be surveyed, we had to resort to academic gathering spots such as the library and coffee shops in order to properly carry out the process. Acquaintances and friends were much more patient with us, and therefore, ended up being the majority of those surveyed. Although we were unable to survey hundreds of random people, we tried to make sure those that we did survey were as diverse in tastes and activities from each other as possible in the hopes span as much of the spectrum as is possible with a relatively small sample size. Goodâ€”that's important We interviewed our separate groups of friends as well as acquaintances who we know take part in different activities. All in all, we believe that our approach was successful in its scope and ability to assess every word in our section, however, we recognize that we may have missed data about words, such as &quot;gaitoring&quot; and &quot;graphics,&quot; which seem obsolete but that still could have limited usage.  Many of the new terms that we added to our section are of local origins, however some of the terms that we included are not local to Geneseo, such as &quot;hazing,&quot; &quot;good looks&quot; and &quot;jungle juice.&quot; We chose to include these despite their universal prevalence in language because their use is widespread on campus and their effects on campus life are noteworthy. In particular, we felt that it was essential to include the definition of the term &quot;hazing&quot; due to the unforgettable connection Geneseo has to its destructive and negative effects. As stated above, other terms, such as &quot;good looks,&quot; are simply indispensible to the vocabulary of our generation and we felt that not including them would portray an inaccurate sketch of our vernacular.  Additionally, we found that the dictionary was severely lacking in terms and abbreviations which pertained to Geneseo specific locations and organizations. Terms like &quot;Livingston,&quot; &quot;Monroe,&quot; and &quot;Gazebo,&quot; which are frequently on the lips of those students who live on campus needed to be added. Similarly, words pertaining to organizations, such as &quot;MAC&quot; and &quot;Gamma Chi,&quot; were shockingly missing from the lexicon. They are so common that at first we did not even notice their absence because these terms are so ingrained in our vocabulary that we assumed that they must have been previously added. We also obtained many new phrases and terms pertaining to Greek life, partying, and drug use, which we felt were important to include as they are commonly used by students. By adding a large number of words used in social circles as well as the general student body we feel that we have positively impacted the expansion of Geneseo dictionary. You clearly show good work in adding words to the dictionary. Finally, we noticed a resurfacing of a variety of words, such as &quot;Kewl&quot;, &quot;Kwinky-dink&quot; and &quot;Muddows,&quot; as well as newly obsolete terms such as &quot;Jamesing,&quot; &quot;HOTEL,&quot; and &quot;Gems.&quot; The resurfacing of these terms could be accounted for due to a possible usage increase in popular media or by our dedication to making sure we interviewed diverse groups of people. The newly obsolete terms, such as &quot;HOTEL,&quot; could have been restricted to a select number of Geneseo students, particularly those who have taken History of the English Language at Geneseo in the past. As mentioned above, due to the fact that we were unable to interview the entire school, this minority was not included in our survey. Therefore, in our posts we made sure to mention that certain group-specific words which seem obsolete, according to our data, may simply have extremely limited usage.  Working closely with the Geneseo dictionary and interviewing a large spectrum of students on campus was an enlightening experience. We learned that many terms which both of us believed were common place were in fact only rarely used by the majority of those interviewed and vice versa. Luckily, from the very beginning of this project we decided to make sure to distance our own personal views and opinions as far away from the task at hand as we could. We feel that our method was well carried out and we believe that our final results are unbiased and as accurate as possible. Judging by the fact that we, as only two students, were able to find a great array of words in such a short amount of time the future of the Dictionary of Geneseo English seems very promising. It can only continue to expand and flourish as subsequent generations of student with increasingly variant vocabularies enter and pass through Geneseo.  This report, as well as your actual work in the dictionary, show indeed how painstaking you both were. The spreadsheet idea (which I'd love to see) sounded efficient, but it also reveals something of the seriousness and detail that you gave to the project. You seem quite aware of the drawbacks of the methods you use, too, while striving to create as diverse and inclusive investigation.  The reference to Webster at the beginning seems quite pertinent.
