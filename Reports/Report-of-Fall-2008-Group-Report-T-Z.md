As a collaborative member of the Dictionary of Geneseo English project, I was assigned the group of letters spanning T-Z. I initially expected to have a certain amount of difficulty with this assignment due to the letters I received. While T had a large amount of entries, the other letters had considerably less. However, I was surprised by the amount of words I was able to add, including the dictionary's first two words starting with X. I also expected a large amount of words from previous editions of the dictionary to be obsolete in today's Geneseo community because of the transient nature of a college population. While there were some rendered as such, I was surprised by the amount of words and phrases that have proven the test of time, such as &quot;that's clutch&quot; and &quot;vendos&quot;.

I began this project by transferring all of the words from the previous dictionary into the new format. I also added a sample sentence for each entry. I then compiled a list of these words in a survey form; an example of an answered survey follows. 

Word               Have you heard this word?     Define, or guess what it          Do you use this word?           

might mean                               

Tundra                         yes                         the field between South                           yes

and the rest of campus   

I chose to include the space to define the word because I realized that some words people recognize may have different or numerous definitions. For example, this helped me infer that the word &quot;tits&quot; as used previously no longer means &quot;really good.&quot; If I had simply asked if people heard that word without clarifying the meaning, results would have been inaccurate. Additionally, I felt it was important to ask if the person being surveyed actually used the word or phrase in question. Because of the nature of some of the words, their definitions could easily be defined contextually, even if it wasn't a word normally used. One example of this was &quot;worshipping the porcelain goddess.&quot; I collected this type of data through written surveys as well as orally. Some words seemed to be unrecognizable on paper, such as &quot;Taw,&quot; but when spoken had different results. 

This survey was first given to my four housemates, who knew essentially the same vocabulary I did. As my participants spread to other people I knew, the similarities between my initial survey and their answers seemed proportional to the amount of time we spent together. I anticipated this, as people who move in similar circles most likely have similar knowledge. Therefore, I realized it was important to collect random samples, as well. However, this proved a little more difficult, as people aren't as willing to help out a stranger asking them about words. However, I did get some quality responses from participants in the library and the Union.

To collect new words for the dictionary, I relied on a few different methods. While surveys were my main source of information for determining the validity of old words, I found that directly asking a person if they knew of any unique Geneseo words resulted in blank stares or negative answers. Instead, I realized that simply listening in on conversations yielded new words that people didn't even realize they were using. This includes &quot;Wegs,&quot; &quot;uggo,&quot; and &quot;UP,&quot; among others. I also included some terms popularized by the widespread use of the internet, instant messaging, and texting, phenomena unique to the past ten years or so. This yielded terms such as &quot;w/e,&quot; &quot;ttyl,&quot; &quot;wtf,&quot; and &quot;tmi.&quot; Finally, I searched through Geneseo's newspaper, the Lamron.

Originally, I got the latest edition and poured through it, hoping a few words would jump off the page. However, this was not a fruitful venture, and I chose to go to the online archives for more editions. Following the advice of Dr. Drake, I concentrated on the &quot;Knight Life&quot; section of the paper, which addresses topics unique to the Geneseo community. Through this section, I found the names of a few groups and clubs that I added. I was also able to add &quot;Under the Knife,&quot; a recurring column that highlights a particular group or club. As this was a collaborative project, some of my words also came from contributions by my classmates. These include &quot;wind tunnel,&quot; &quot;window licker,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;whale tail.&quot;

When it came to finalizing the words entered in the dictionary, I decided to keep all of the words in the previous edition, even those originating in the 1999 edition and rendered obsolete in 2006. I believe it will be interesting to see how words evolve over the years, and whether some that might have been ruled obsolete today might come back into use. For place names, I kept those that were not the proper name, such as &quot;Wads.&quot; While the previous edition had &quot;University Drive,&quot; I shortened it to &quot;University,&quot; as that is what it is often called. I had a bit more trouble with the words &quot;The City&quot; and &quot;The Island,&quot; as &quot;the&quot; is an article not included in alphabetical order, therefore removing both words from my span of letters. However, including them on the survey showed that &quot;The&quot; was an integral part in the phrases, as it was what indicated New York City instead of a general city, so the phrases were left intact.

Overall, I noticed that the majority of the words included in the dictionary are nouns.  This was not particularly surprising to me, as I also tend to give names to certain people, objects, or places I come across frequently. Additionally, it is important to stress the impact technology has had on the development of vocabulary. As mentioned earlier, the internet has led to the development of an entirely new language. I included only a few of the most popular ones that have crossed over into verbal communication, as well. Interestingly, a majority of these terms are acronyms, suggesting the impatience of today's population. However, technology's rapid evolutions also leave some words as obsolete after a certain amount of time, such as &quot;Vaxaholic.&quot; The media has also played a large role in the development of language here at Geneseo. In the 2006 Dictionary, &quot;worthy&quot; was included, a term popularized by the movie &quot;Wayne's World.&quot; The 2008 edition includes two more additions: &quot;uggo&quot; and &quot;xoxo,&quot; brought to Geneseo via the television shows &quot;Scrubs&quot; and &quot;Gossip Girl,&quot; respectively. 

Because of the high degree of interconnectedness the world has today, it is hard to find words and terms used only by a very small community. However, especially in the case of names of places, Geneseo has proven to have a unique vocabulary that is representative of its community.
