The language spoken at Geneseo is in a constant state of change that corresponds with the changes in society and popularized media, which we attempted to properly document through revisions and additions to the Geneseo Wiki. From the book by Elizabeth Murray entitled “Caught in the Web of Words”, the Lexicographer's job is to “To show the life history of every word, its origin and any changes of form and meaning. As a historian of the language, not a critic, the lexicographer’s task was to collect all words, rather than to select good words... ” (Murray, 133-134). This standard is what our group strongly identified with as we went through the dictionary. We did our best to act as unbiased historians of the language used at Geneseo in order to see how it has changed and evolved over time.The first step in our process of updating the dictionary was counting how many words and phrases were in our specific section of the dictionary. Upon first glance of our assigned section in the Geneseo Wiki, we could immediately identify which words were commonly used and which were not. As a group, we decided it would be beneficial to separate the words into equal portions and assign each person approximately 30-32 words. We decided this because we assumed that not many students at Geneseo would want to complete a survey that would take longer than five minutes. Each person worked individually to create their own Google survey with their assigned words in order to receive formal data on the words in order to see what words were obsolete. We decided that having a minimum of fifteen responses per person was reasonable so that there would be a total of 105 responses. On the survey, we asked the same question for each word: “How often do you hear or use the word,” and gave the options of “never”, “seldom”, “sometimes”, “often” and “all the time” for students to choose from. We made sure to include a spectrum of possible answers because the answer to the use of a word is not always as simple as “yes” or “no” and we wanted results that were as precise as possible. However, we knew the attention span of the students we would be interviewing would be short, so we limited it to only the five option scale. Since many of our words had multiple different definitions, we made sure to include the specific both the definition of the word and the part of speech next to the question for people to refer to as they choose their answer.Each person in our group had their own methods for spreading their own survey around campus to various people at Geneseo. A handful of us belong to various clubs, sports teams, or other organizations on campus so it was much easier to find people to answer our surveys. The diversity of our group and the wide variety of organizations we take part in caused a rather diverse population to complete the survey. One person who works as an RA simply texted their residents and asked them to fill out the survey while another sent the survey to her sorority and received responses that way. The other members that are not in organizations had a slightly harder time spreading their survey, but did so through friends and even going up to strangers they did not know and asking to email them the survey. The idea to split up the words in the dictionary amongst the group was one that proved to be greatly beneficial because of how quickly the smaller surveys could be completed and by a much larger spectrum of people. Each survey averaged the same amount of questions and thus elicited the same amount of responses.When completing our surveys, we came to the realization that the written word is very different from conversational use of language, and because of this distinction we made sure to use two different forms of surveying. By surveying people formally through Google Survey and then informally by testing out our new words in conversation, we were able to collect different types of results. The popularity of a word ties very closely to how often it is used and typically, the younger generation are the ones who are responsible for the creation of new slang words and phrases. Language varies based on where you are from and the different cultures you are exposed to within the Geneseo community. After gathering all the necessary responses, we got back together to discuss our results from our formal survey. Since Geneseo is a small community, the words and slang in the Geneseo English Dictionary are well known and used amongst most people. The words that were deemed to be obsolete were words that as a group we also had either never heard before or rarely ever used. When determining which word was considered obsolete, we took into account how many people had never heard or used a term before. For example, if over an average of 80-90% of people had not heard or used a word before, it would be then be marked as obsolete in the Geneseo English Dictionary.One of the major struggles some of our group members went through were the choices of words from the N and R category as it pertains to racial slurs and terms involving violent acts such as rape. As a result, we all agreed to refrain from asking people about those terms in person and in public because we were uncomfortable with saying it aloud. We knew just how obscene these words were and did not want to offend anyone nearby who may not have known that this was part of our dictionary project. We had concerns about these sets of terms, but after consulting Dr. Drake we understood the importance of maintaining history as linguists. The members responsible for those sets of terms were reminding people that those were are extremely inappropriate and should not be used carelessly. To our relief, complains and surprised reactions from those being surveyed also informed us that those terms were not used casually. Although we are all still uncomfortable with the idea of those words and its definitions, we learned that we have to be able to discuss any word and understand its etymology no matter how offensive it is.Examples of words we marked as obsolete are “o-face” “roast a bone,” “randy,” “rape lane,” and “rape lot.” All of these words received a majority of “never” responses which signified to us that the people who were surveyed had never heard or used the word. The words which ended up being marked obsolete did not particularly surprise us because we had never heard of those terms either. The words listed above all had either drug or sex-related definition tied to them, some obviously more positive than others. This also did not surprise us because slang terms for drug and sex-related activities are constantly changing in any environment, but especially on a college campus. We noticed that although those terms are not used anymore, there are similar slang terms with similar definitions that have taken their place and become more popular. The words that we considered popular now will most likely disappear within the next several years.Generating new terms was actually much more difficult than we had originally anticipated. To start, we looked at words that were commonly used in Greek social organization such as “pledge mom,” as well as “afters,” which was not a term within our span of assigned letters, and were able to come up with sixteen new words in total. Individually, we took all of these new words and tested them through informal personal interviews with students and friends, casually using them in conversation to gauge whether these new words were familiar to them. Conversational terminology and linguistics, in particular, are constantly changing and evolving and by using casual dialogue to collect data on our new words we were able to receive different types of responses that were more genuine than surveys, which could be influenced by an honest unawareness that an individual uses certain slang terms as often as they really do. It was great to have this insight and different type of data on how often other people used the words we considered to be commonly used. An example of a word that other people did not find extremely common was, “plug: (n) someone who supplies drugs or alcohol.” We were quite surprised at the result of this word because we thought everyone would have at least heard this word commonly in a college campus. “Plug” is not an obsolete word, but we anticipated more people knowing the term than we recorded. Another word was the term, “PMS: (n.) Premenstrual Syndrome which is a time in which a female experiences certain symptoms the week before her period.” Understandably, women who were surveyed all said they have both used and heard of the word all the time while men were either unsure or seldom used and heard the word. Another word that we came up with was “Rancho Viejo,” which is the name of a local Mexican restaurant here in Geneseo. This term is special because, unlike the majority of our other new terms, it is specific to the town and is therefore only known to the people who live there or who frequent the Geneseo area. Those living downstate or anywhere else outside of this college town will be confused by this term. This term is not used commonly in everyday dialogue, but most everyone who goes here will be at least familiar with this term.            During our survey process, we had a somewhat difficult time finding different groups of people outside our normal social circle to question. Most of us gathered our information through our online survey that we sent out to friends. Of course, with friends it is more common that they will use the same type of language that we all normally use. Sending the survey out to people we already know and socialize with daily brought about the results that we initially anticipated. To get the most accurate results regarding slang use at Geneseo, we should have gathered answers from the entire SUNY Geneseo student body, but this would have been impossible to realistically achieve. However, it was possible for us to have gone outside our comfort zones and gotten more in-person surveying. That way, we would have a more diverse group contributing to our results. There would certainly be people out there who still use certain slang terms that we have never heard of before.            In the book “From Memory to Written Record in England, 1066-1307” by Michael Clanchy, he referenced the need for a archive as people were transitioning from the reliance on the spoken word to written texts. As time went on, the need for storing became more important “to keep documents for perpetual remembrance had been the purpose of archives for centuries; what was new was the demand that records should be readily available ‘at all times’” (Clanchy 154). This storage then led to the need for an alphabetical index which was created to help with organization. The Dictionary of Geneseo reflects the importance of a written record. It is necessary to keep track of history and mark the changes made over the years as the college cultural shifts. We can all recognize the history of each individual term and it encourages us to think about how those terms may have been used in the past and how they could be used in the future. Every single word listed on the Geneseo Wiki, no matter how long it has been labeled as obsolete, is significant to our understanding of our community.            We have demonstrated a great understanding of the words in the Geneseo English Dictionary, as well as their etymology. We noticed how words that were previously marked obsolete continued to stay that way and how recently added words were starting to become popularized. While we cannot speak for every person in the Geneseo community as to their knowledge of the terms we tested, it is safe to say that we tried our best to gather the most diverse set of results possible. We found over twenty-six words to be obsolete and we were fascinated with how these words had been used, given the example the dictionary provided. It is interesting to think about how much the language has changed in the span of only a decade. Through our testing, we were able to reflect on how the community has changed along with the changes in the language we use. We are eager to look back on these results and see if these terms we consider to be widely known will still be used years from now. ReferenceClanchy, M.T.
