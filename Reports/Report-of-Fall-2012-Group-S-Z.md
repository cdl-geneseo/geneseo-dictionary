Group S-Z Emily Oberdorf, Elizabeth Reck, Lindsey Rumfola, Rachel Myers, Tim Moriarty ENGL 361, Fall 2012 Dr. Drake                     After receiving letters S-Z, our group immediately began to schedule times to meet.  We sent out and completed a very comprehensive doodle (schedule managing tool from doodle.com) to see what times everyone was available.  This worked very well as we knew that each member was free from 5pm to 9pm every Monday night.  We met at either five or six on Mondays at least every other week for the entire semester without complicating events because of our immediate time management.At our first meeting we decided to assign the work that needed to be completed.  We decided to portion the work into five main parts: word revision, word collection, survey concept research, and physical and online surveying.  This work was divided among our original six group members, until one left the class.  The remaining work was taken up and redistributed. When looking at the word list on the Geneseo Wiki Dictionary, we made a comprehensive list of all the words in our section.  We organized the words into three categories: words that were understandable and still being used, words that were understandable but not part of everyday language, and words that were completely obsolete. The words that were understandable and currently being used were not words we wanted on the survey. We then removed, from our list not the wiki, all obsolete words which remained obviously obsolete, i.e. Yuppie Food Stamps, Shaq Diesel.  From this stage we looked at each entry to determine which needed updating, or were questionably obsolete. We decided to include only words which we struggled with the most in our survey.  We limited our list to fifteen entries to form a concise survey which could be taken by many people, quickly and conveniently.In the course of our work we, of course, had to look for new additions to the dictionary. We began by wracking our brains for new slang. Not only did we consult our own past and present conversation vocabularies, but we also asked friends for input, listened carefully to student conversations around campus, watched Facebook, and looked through the “Overheard at Geneseo” Facebook page, which boasts thousands of quotes heard by the student body. Our discoveries in this category include, but are not limited to, “spinners” referring to tex-mex previously served in Letchworth Dining Hall, “zombies” referring to the antagonists in the game Humans vs Zombies, and “YOLO,” which developed last year as an acronym for “you only live once.”The majority of our additions actually came from names of campus-related places and organizations. The dictionary already contained slang terms for dorms and dorm residents such as “Steubennery” which combines “Steuben” and “nunnery.” There was not, however, a single real dorm name on the list. These are an integral part of Geneseo English and we found it odd that none of them had been previously included. It was just our luck that the vast majority of dorm names come at the end of the alphabet.  In the same category we also added building names like “Welles” and “Wadsworth,” street names like “Twenty-A,” and campus organization names like “Sigma Tau Delta” and “Southside Boys.”In total we added 31 words and made 33 revisions to the existing entries. We revised and added information to several entries. We thought, for instance, that “Seuss Spruce” and “U-hots” were more accurate than “Dr. Spruce Tree” and “University Hots,” which are both very formal terms for widely accepted colloquialisms.When formulating our group’s survey we decided that we wanted to include a short-answer section as well as a multiple choice section. This would be helpful for testing word knowledge in more than one way: multiple-choice questions give the survey-taker more context about the word while short-answer does not provide any context but allows the survey-taker to give more input from their own knowledge about the word. In the case of “SOPA”, “SOTA”, and “Sodomy Lot” we felt that the words were used but not with the definition included in the slang dictionary. We also thought that “Special Talent” was something that would be recognized under different definitions by different groups of students. The “Tundra” and “Wayne Manor” were questionable words in that some of us knew of their usage while others hadn’t.As a way to collect data the short-answer section worked exactly as we hoped it would.  We were able to see clear changes in word usage and to get a better idea of whether or not people could really define some of these words and terms. In general, we felt that most of the people taking the survey could probably pick the correct definition from a list but we felt that that wasn’t enough for us to say that the word was generally known. The short-answer section also allowed us to gauge the changes in the word’s usage. For example, many of the responses to “Special Talent” indicated that people thought it either had a literal meaning or a meaning that implied a sexual talent. “Sodomy Lot” also had a wide range of responses that were split between specific locations and a general location.In our exploration of options for the dissemination of our survey, we first realized that it would be necessary to find a program that allowed for multiple question format options. We considered “SurveyMonkey” but eventually decided to use Google Docs. Using Google Docs for a survey is very convenient for both the surveyor and the surveyed. It allows for easy use of many different kinds of question formats and can be accessed through a simple URL link (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dElQazY2dzVxbnZZOVQtYVNNUl91eXc6MQ#gid=0). These online surveys are also anonymous, so the person taking the survey could be sure that their answers would remain private and are thus more likely to share their true thoughts about the words. For the online portion of surveying we then created a Facebook “event” with the link to the survey in the description. We invited various Facebook friends from Geneseo to the online event and requested that they fill out the survey.Our physical surveys were handed out in different classes in the Education and English departments.  These physical forms made up the bulk of our responses but proved to be much more difficult to collect data from.  Where we had fifteen responses from the online surveys, the in-person surveys yielded a total of seventy-one physical forms.  While the online surveys provided anonymity and convenience, the in-person surveys had better results and greatly increased our sample size to eighty-six.Our original goal was was to reach a sample size of fifty people.  Our final sample size of eighty-six ended up surpassing this goal. In order to gather the data in a timely fashion as well as avoid the busy time after Thanksgiving Break, we completed our survey taking and data analysis before the holiday.  Our analysis was complete by November twentieth which meant group members could use the data while forming comments on individual word entries.Data analysis for the survey was based on correct definition identification.  Multiple choice questions were analyzed for correct response as well as the short answer questions.  We had a sample size of eighty-six with fifteen of those surveys coming from the online Facebook event page.  Of the words surveyed, the multiple choice section had a higher instance of correct recognition than the fill-in-the-blank section.  The highest instance of word recognition of 78/86 belonged to “UP” as an acronym for “University Police.”  This was followed closely by the recognition rate of 77/86 for “Traying,” a time honored Geneseo tradition of illegally sledding down the Geneseo hills in winter on stolen dining hall trays.  The terms “Spinner,” “Wayno,” and “Tits McGee” also performed passably well with scores of 64/86, 60/86, and 57/86 respectively.The words which did not receive at least a fifty percent recognition rate remained close to the half way mark.  “Window Licker,” a person of below average intellect, was recognized 42/86 times as was “Teke,” a disbanded fraternity from 2006.  Although, in the case of “Teke” nearly half of the surveys indicated the alternative answer of “a joint” was an appealing definition as well.  The playful addition of “-s” to the end of a word with no meaning performed below expectation with only 40/86 recognizing it.  When listening around campus it is widely used and not Geneseo specific.  Obfuscating wording of the question may be to blame here.  Alternatively, because it had no meaning aside from adding playfulness to conversation it may occur on a subconscious level which is not recognized and therefore would remain distant from the responses.  The word with the lowest recognition rate was “Subzone.”  It had only 35/86 correct responses.The short response section where participants were asked to write a definition for the given term was less successful in terms of correct recognition.  “The Wayne Manor,” a play on The Batman’s alter ego’s home and Wayne residence hall, was the most recognized with a score of 34/86.  The “Geneseo Tundra,” (with acceptable definitions taken to be fields towards the Southside of campus or specifically the Townhouse area) scored only a 26/86.  This low score was echoed in the ranking “Special Talent,” being allowed into Geneseo for athletic and not academic performance, of 18/86.A new definition for the acronym “SOPA” was revealed during our survey.  As we were suspicious of the acronym’s previous definition (School of the Performing Arts) confusion with the “Stop Online Piracy Act” of 2011-2012, it was included in the short answer section.  Only nine people correctly identified SOPA as a Geneseo specific term dealing with the School of the Performing Arts and the entry in the Geneseo Wiki previously stated.  Contrasting with this was the higher instance of recognition of the acronym as the Internet Piracy act with a total of 13/86.  This small increase but the nine who recognized SOPA as a Geneseo specific term either did so in conjunction with SOTA (School of The Arts 7/86, ) or by itself, 2/86.  The recognition of SOTA as a standalone acronym was much higher at 6/86.In addition to the introduction of a new definition for SOPA, we also included a term from outside our category “Rape Lane/Fence” because of its connection to “Sodomy Lot.”  Where “Sodomy Lot” was defined correctly (correctly is here defined as a lot on the Geneseo campus being named as the location) only 10/86 times, “Rape Lane” (The path between the back of Sturges Hall and MacVittie Union) was identified more than three times as much, with the additional note of its lesser seriousness when compared to “Sodomy Lot.”Considering that many of the words in S-Z were already tagged as obsolete by previous ENGL 361 students, our main work consisted of identifying new words to add and revising definitions of other existing entries. With the least recognized term being SOPA/SOTA, we decided that explicit recognition was not necessary.  Most students realized it was a reference to the School of the Arts even if they did not fully write out their conclusion.  Aside from this, a sample size of eighty-six is not fully representative of the 5,200 students attending Geneseo.  Each term will find greater use by certain social groups and it was not possible for us to take a perfectly representative sample. By expanding the number of entries in the Geneseo Wiki Dictionary and updating definitions of certain existing entries, we contributed to the ongoing project of recording the unique language of Geneseo.
