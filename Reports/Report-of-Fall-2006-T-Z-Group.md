Dictionaries are a part of our everyday lives as students and faculty at Geneseo, from the Oxford English Dictionary to the quick use of Wikipedia online. With that said, they are probably one of the aspects of our academic lives that we take for granted the most.  Over the past semester, our class has participated in the composition of the SUNY Geneseo Wiki dictionary.  Through the composition of this literature, we have come to appreciate the social constructions of language that we encounter everyday at Geneseo.

After receiving our dictionary entries, it seemed that the most logical first step would be to look at them as a group.  The six of us met in the library and went through the past dictionaries word by word.  We discussed whether or not we had heard the words, and in what context.  If there were words that somebody in the group recognized and used we would talk about it, and then consider that to be an actively used word. Sometimes, a word, for instance, &quot;steez&quot; would be known to one person in the group because of their own particular activities, such as track or working in the Workout Center.  

We also decided which words were obsolete and what words may have been becoming obsolete.  However, there were a few words with which we were uncertain of their use, so we took note of these. We each took a couple of words from this list, and started to compose our first survey.  Each of us was assigned a couple different words or phrases, such as &quot;technicolor yawn&quot; or &quot;traying.&quot;  We composed the survey with the words we were assigned and then gave them to 15 different people.  We wanted to be sure that these words were either active or obsolete.  Because of our uncertainty, we did not think that the six of us was a large enough sample size to determine this factor.

One method our group used was to peruse materials printed on campus or by campus groups. To begin, a few of our group members read through The Lamron. This yielded mixed results. Examples of some words we came across were terms for a weekly column, entitled YAWA (you ask, we answer) and a group we were unaware of: UAA (Undergraduate Alumni Association). While The Lamron did generate a few words, scanning the pages was a lengthy process. Overall this method was not very efficient. In addition to The Lamron, we made efforts to read the flyers posted in buildings such as Newton and Sturges. A majority of the words found here were either not Geneseo specific, for example titles of movies for the International Film Series, or were too specific, for example names for student art shows. Finally, we read through the What's-Up digest to look for the names of groups on campus. Although we didn't find any, we did include the term itself What's-Up in our portion of the dictionary.

The What's-Up digest, sent to all students who haven't unsubscribed, reaches a large portion of the student body. We had hoped to reach a similar population by sending out an electronic survey. Unfortunately, one of the other groups alerted us to the fact that this type of mass emailing is not allowed. Upon reflection, we decided that an email survey would likely receive a low response rate. Most of us admitted to ignoring similar emails, such as the What's-Up previously mentioned. We considered sending chain emails to our friends, asking them to forward the message to others, but ultimately decided that these emails would be both annoying and easy to ignore. In keeping with the electronic trend, some of our group members joined the Facebook group for the Geneseo Wiki created by one of our classmates. Surprisingly, few people posted suggestions despite the large number of members. Considering that students check their email and Facebook regularly, we expected electronic methods of collecting data to yield greater results. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

One online venture that we did gain some success from was the use of UrbanDictionary.Com. We all went to the dictionary with a letter assigned to us and picked one or two words to survey the student population about. We quickly learned that a large portion of the words on the UrbanDictionary.Com were words that might be considered as somewhat unsavory to those we were surveying, and we felt slightly uncomfortable asking these words. We also felt that the words were for the most part not very helpful because they were gathered from a much larger population than Geneseo, and students at Geneseo were unfamiliar with many of the words that we found.

In an effort to find words that were maybe not so apparent to us as students, we surveyed some faculty to see if they had noticed any words that we might have overlooked. Obviously, looking for words that tend to be &quot;student-specific,&quot; might sometimes be more difficult for us to notice because we hear them so often we don't even notice them. It was difficult for faculty to come up with words off the top of their heads, and most weren't so invested in the project that they wanted to spend time thinking about it much beyond the time that they spoke with us. As with much of the rest of the population that we surveyed looking for new words, it sometimes felt that the faculty did not take us entirely seriously. 

To combat the problem that we encountered with putting people on the spot, we decided that a group setting might put people more at ease. We went to groups of people with our surveys, asking people to think of words that were specific to our college community. We went to see groups such as the Financial Club, and a sorority. Another group member spoke to her entire floor in her residence hall during a hall meeting. While people certainly felt more at ease, we encountered another problem: people were much more excitable in groups and seemed unable to focus on the task at hand. 

Furthermore, we found that we still had the same problem of getting people to take us seriously. 

One area of the dictionary project that we found really helpful was the group progress reports in class. It was neat to hear what other groups were doing to find new words, and we found that there were methods of word collecting that we had never considered. We also found it helpful because we found out about school policies, for instance those regarding mass emails, from the other groups, and this saved us time. We were able to take ideas that some groups had and then add our own spin to them. We then applied them to our own research methods. 

The issue of sharing words amongst groups proved to be more of a hassle than we expected or considered necessary Throughout the project we were neither given words nor shared any through the official process. We attribute this to the rules regarding the submission of words to other groups. We felt that if we could simply post them in the appropriate section there would have been a greater exchange of ideas. Many of us did not know which letters belonged to which groups and thus did not know whom to approach. Also, some of us didn't feel comfortable approaching classmates because we didn't know them very well. Perhaps a list of group leaders to contact could have prevented this problem. 

One of the greatest difficulties our group had starting this project was with the section of the alphabet we were assigned.  Looking at the letters in the group T-Z, it became clear that in a few cases, such as with the letters X, V, and Z; we would not be successful in finding an abundance of new words.  There are not many terms or phrases that start with these letters in the alphabet that are used in our everyday language, much less the Geneseo vocabulary.  For example, there were no words added into the dictionary that start with the letter X.  The words we did enter into the dictionary that began with uncommon letters, such as V and Z, tended to be more irregular and only known by a few people. This caused group to seriously pose the question as to whether or not these words are now obsolete on campus.

We felt that there was one aspect of project that did not go well through at least partially our own fault. When initiating our research, we were adamant in searching for new words and phrases that were unique to groups in Geneseo and had meanings we may not have been aware of.  Granted, this was an important part of our surveying tactic in order to fill the Wiki.  Unfortunately, this approach to our investigation seemed to blind sight us from more general words that should have been the first to be entered in.  For example, we surveyed words such as 'yarf' and 'techni-color yawn', and spent a decent amount of time analyzing their usage among students and faculty.  It wasn't until the tail end of our investigation that we realized terms such as  'Tavern' and 'Workout Center' had never been added to our section of the dictionary in prior years, and they are much more common to Geneseo vernacular.   

The third issue we had that caused our research to suffer a bit was the disinterest of those we surveyed around campus, and their tendency to give invalid answers.  Each member of our group conducted a number of surveys, and at each of our meetings we would agree that most of the people we surveyed were not taking the questions as seriously as we had hoped.  Many interviewees tended to make up definitions of words they didn't know on the surveys, or they would try to associate the words with what they thought they were supposed to mean.  This did not help our group verify whether or not these words were actually used on campus, however.  

The results of our efforts are numerous, but not varied. The amount of nouns we compiled are far more abundant than any other part of speech, mostly because this is the part of speech most readily given by those surveyed. But it is also due to the fact that most places and things are immovable and unchanging, like &quot;Ward Street&quot; or &quot;The Workout Center&quot;, and these accounted for a large chunk of the nouns. Additionally, most of the words assessed to still be relevant from the previous dictionaries were nouns as well. What this seems to suggest it a lack of a centralized lingo in Geneseo. Buildings, stores and the like continue to hold the same names, but the adverbs, verbs, and so on that are used by specific people become unknown in a short amount time. Even some nouns, like &quot;Technicolor Vomit&quot; and &quot;Yuppie Food Stamps&quot; were most likely known only to a select few. The glue that bonds the campus community together is the discourse about the buildings, streets, and bars, which does not appear to be a very strong bond, and reveals a disjointed community.  The words we have gathered in surveys and listening to people around campus seemed to be specialized to different groups. Perhaps clubs, teams, and other social groups continue a legacy of words their own, but they do not shape the campus at large. We predict that, beyond all of the place names we've provided, the majority of the words we have added will be rare or obsolete the next time this project is done. We think this is because terms that are created here and used amongst friends migrate along with their users after their time at Geneseo has ended. This makes Geneseo the birthplace of many new words now drifting around the country, but the campus itself cannot retain them for its own use.
