Report

Through endless trials and tribulations and taking &quot;arms against a sea of troubles,&quot; Group &quot;A through D&quot; staked its claim on Geneseo's dictionary on the Wiki this semester.  We were fortunate that all of our letters possessed an extraordinary ability to be used at the beginnings of words in the English language, specifically in words that are highly inappropriate, such as &quot;butthead.&quot;  We were successful in testing several new words, and (not surprisingly) unsuccessful in finding definitions for obsolete words.  Many different approaches were discussed as to how we would &quot;get the word out&quot; on campus about the dictionary project, and we attempted some of these as well.

After testing the words from previous dictionaries we compiled a list of new words that we wanted to test.  We collected these terms from many different sources - other people, our general knowledge, maps, and online websites.  Additionally, to include the views of the people we originally surveyed, we left a blank area at the bottom of the last page for our participants to contribute any new words that they felt should be included on the Geneseo Wiki.  Although each of us typed up our original surveys separately, all of our requests generally stated: &quot;In the following space, please list and define any other words which you feel should be added to the Geneseo Wiki.&quot;  This plea was met with some new words, but not many.

At this point, we decided to &quot;put our heads together&quot; and think of a new list of words by looking at the campus around us.  Words such as &quot;Center Street&quot; and &quot;Chestnut Street&quot; came from looking at campus and village maps.  We also included words of campus organizations (e.g. &quot;Cothurnus&quot; and &quot;Clio&quot;) and places on the campus itself (e.g. &quot;College Green&quot; and &quot;Daga&quot;).  Off-campus areas, such as student apartment complexes and shops/restaurants on Main Street also provided us with new terms (e.g. &quot;Courtside&quot; and &quot;Club 41&quot;).  

In order to get some words relating to the Geneseo pop culture, we went on the Facebook website (http://www.facebook.com).  Under &quot;About&quot; &gt; &quot;Pulse&quot; we checked what the top choices for Geneseo students were in such areas as music, movies, and television according to what was listed in their Facebook profiles.  It was on this site that we came up with new words such as &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;DMB&quot; or &quot;Dave Matthews Band.&quot;

After surveying out new words for the Wiki, we started testing our obsolete words.  Not surprisingly, most of these words were found to be obsolete.  We tested them (in survey form) along with all of the other words in our dictionaries, and no one knew what they meant.  To provide a general idea of the character of these words, we will include a few examples:

Bad-loaf: (NN) Bad experience

Bloompy: (AJ) With rolls of fat

BMS: (NN) Barren Mailbox Syndrome (acronym influenced by PMS-Pre Menstrual Syndrome)

Clusterfuck: (NN) unknown by any participants

Crap-paper: (NN) The Lamron

On the other hand, there was one word— Brodie-ite—which was said to be obsolete, but it was found to be used by people when describing those who frequent Brodie Hall.  In one other instance, a student did know what an obsolete word meant.  We all had our guesses as to what many of them meant, but realized that, for the purposes of this project, we needed to find words that were actually used.  Of course &quot;bloompy&quot; means &quot;with rolls of fat&quot;—people just prefer to use &quot;fat-ass&quot; today instead, probably because &quot;bloompy&quot; sounds more like a character in a children's television program than an insult.  Many of these obsolete words, like most of the words that are still in use, may be described as slightly offensive and/or inappropriate for conversation with any upstanding individual.  

We tried to vary our survey methods, some of which were successful and some unsuccessful.  Using the previous Geneseo dictionaries, we divided the words up amongst ourselves and each tested the words via paper survey.  Once we had compiled a satisfactory list of new words, we tested them, with the paper survey.  For words that were not recognized/defined, we tested those again to rule out the possibility that the word may be unfamiliar, primarily due to its use in specific communities within Geneseo.  These specific communities may have been higher as opposed to lower classmen, departmental communities, athletic communities, etc.

The paper surveys requested population-identifying material such as gender and class year.  Following that, the words were listed against the left margin and double-spaced to allow for a sufficient area in which to define the terms.  When we received unexpected definitions, we retested the words in another survey - this time including the word and its part of speech.  This was intended for words like, &quot;chalk;&quot; in which case we had received its definition as &quot;a writing utensil for a blackboard.&quot;  However, since this definition is not specific to Geneseo, by including the part of speech, we received definitions of &quot;chalk&quot; like &quot;a form of written expression or mass communication to the Geneseo college community regarding various world, local, or college events.&quot;   

In addition to the paper surveys, a video comprised of live interviews was conducted of various students, a sample of which is attached to the paper.  The idea behind the video is to attain a more spontaneous and frank response from the participants, which may not necessarily be achieved through a paper survey, which allows for more time for thought about words which may not naturally occur to an individual.  The words sampled covered areas of geography and organizations around Geneseo, for instance &quot;Ago,&quot; the Alpha Kappa Phi sorority, &quot;Avon,&quot; a neighboring town.  Other terms involved drinking, as in the verb form of &quot;boot,&quot; meaning to vomit, and &quot;Drunk Bus,&quot; or the bus service that goes throughout campus.  There were few discrepancies amongst the words tested, except &quot;Ago&quot; was sometimes confused with &quot;Eggo&quot; brand waffles, and amongst some athletes, &quot;boot&quot; simply meant &quot;to kick.&quot; There was one term deemed to be obsolete, which was &quot;canine,&quot; intended to refer to &quot;doggy style&quot; sex, but its use was found to be limited to a small group, consequently the few friends I personally live with.

The video was fun to conduct and proved to be a rather successful form of survey, yet it still had its faults.  In some cases, after the interview had concluded, participants admitted to realizing some of the terms had other connotations, but that they were just nervous in front of the camera.  This only happened in a small number of cases, so it did not affect the data too greatly.  It was a nice change of pace from paper surveys, and did seem to achieve a more genuine response. 

Another survey method used that proved to be useful was sending emails to students on campus.  Almost everyone responded and in a timely manner.   These emails were not long in nature and responses provided great quality.  Also, the group sent four words out to the students via the WhatsUp-L Digest as a form of electronic surveying.  However, this method proved to be unsuccessful.  We did not get any responses for the words we sent out.  We did, however, get a word suggestion that was already being tested.

When brainstorming ways to research words to add to the Geneseo Wiki, we decided that a good way to accumulate new words would be through live interviews conducted at a Geneseo Late Knight activity.  We would be able to interview people while they were doing the activity and we would be getting the word out about the Geneseo Wiki.  A proposal was sent into Late Knight to do a program called Word Up.  Participants would decorate shirts with puffy paint, sparkles, etc.  On the front of the shirt the person would write &quot;Geneseo Wiki,&quot; and on the back they would write a word and the definition that they believed should be added to the dictionary.  At the beginning of the event we would explain to the participants what the Geneseo Wiki entails and how to access it.  The Late Knight coordinators said they liked the idea for the activity, but it was not possible to do it on any of the days the group suggested.

We decided as a group that we still wanted to do live interviews at a Late Knight event, because they are popular and generally have a lot of student participation.  We choose to go to a Late Knight event on Thursday November 30, sponsored by Geneseo First Response.  GFR was making Styrofoam ornaments to deliver to a nursing home.  Everyone in the group arrived at nine o'clock when the event started.  The Geneseo First Response team was already there setting up, waiting for people to arrive, but there were no students there to participate.  The group did not know what to do, so we discussed different options.  We decided to approach the GFR team to ask them for words.  We explained to them what we were doing and what the project was about.  Unfortunately, the GFR team was unable to think of any words to add to the dictionary.  However, we did come to an agreement with them—they agreed to fill out paper surveys if we made ornaments.  Our group sat down and made ornaments while the members of GFR filled out our surveys.  Gradually, more people came to the event and asked if they could fill out paper surveys.  While the live interviews did not go as well as we had hoped, we did get some more paper surveys filled out.  Overall, the Late Knight was successful both because of this and because we did something nice for nursing home residents. 

The language shared by students on the Geneseo campus is definitely a distinct one. Words for places, streets, services, and unusual phenomena unique to the Geneseo community have all arisen as a result of five thousand students living in the same place and experiencing the same environment. Just as English-speaking nations such as Australia, India or Canada have their own unique English vocabularies, Geneseo, on a smaller scale, has words that might be meaningless to one that goes to a school as close as Buffalo. While we cannot compile a definitive dictionary of every word ever uttered in Geneseo that is distinct to the Geneseo community, we strove for a complete lexicon of Geneseo English. This project showed us that a language is dynamic, and whenever groups of speakers come together, a new vocabulary can develop through mere usage of a common language. Whether it is the major development of a language over time or a few common slang words, the English language has come a long way, and it will continue to change with the progression of time.
