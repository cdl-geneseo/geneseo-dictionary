Fall 2012- History of the English LanguageGeneseo Dictionary Project- Group G-M The members of the G-M group began their research by first familiarizing themselves with their words as listed in the Dictionary of Geneseo English. As we were reading through the list, we felt that there were natural distinctions amongst the words. We used these distinctions to create four main categories. Once the categories had been established, as a group we read through every word and definition, discussed our personal views on the status of the word, and signified it to a category. The categories we created are as follows – Strictly Geneseo-related; Used universally; Word is fine but definition needs alteration; Archaic/out of use, but will be tested in our survey. Our surveys, with some alterations, generally reflected those four initial categories.            The majority of our words had been most recently updated in 2010; some had the most recent edit occur in 2006 or 2008. Considering the relatively short two-year time frame for the majority of the words, we did not expect to find any significant changes with the status of these words. Ultimately, we decided to focus the surveys on word origin. We were mostly hoping to find, in broad terms, whether or not students were familiar with the word and where they had first heard it.Because of the breadth of words we were responsible for surveying, we chose to separate our group into sub-groups, each responsible for a smaller section of the words. We knew that we wanted each word to be surveyed by at least forty students; in breaking down our group into sub-groups, we made the amount of work per person less overwhelming, and ensured that each word would receive the full survey attention that it required. We split the groups as such – (G) Candice, Rose, and Sean F.; (H-J) Sean E., Joe; (K-M) Margaret, Megan. As a group, we created a “master survey” which gave a sample of how we were choosing to survey our words. Each sub-group was allowed to alter this “master survey” to fit their personal format of distribution; ultimately everyone designed their own personal survey, based off the general group consensus. The three members of the “G” group each re-designed the survey to their own personal preference. Working in a group of three on the “G” words presented a unique opportunity in that, by having a larger number of surveyed Geneseo students than those of the people in the two person groups, we were able to put time and effort into actually seeing which words were slang terms rooted in Geneseo culture.  Sean Fisher created an online survey to match the one he was giving to Geneseo students, which was essentially the same as the original format proposed, he was able to share our word list with students from the University of Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh.  As these three schools are all of varying distances from Geneseo, have different amounts of interaction with Geneseo, and are unique in their own school cultures, they were ideal testing grounds to see which words were common to all college communities.  The sample sizes from these schools were not as deep as those from Geneseo because of a limited number of connections at each, but still provided meaningful results.            The results in question are so powerful because of the relationship between a definition and the notion that it is “unique” to Geneseo.  For a definition to be “unique” to Geneseo, no students at any other schools would have to know the definition, or to have at least learned it from the Geneseo population.  While a lack of knowledge on the part of the sample groups would not confirm “uniqueness” to Geneseo, the presences of knowledge of word definitions with a lack of learning them from the Geneseo population would confirm a sort of universal college nature for the definition.In her “G” surveys, Rose found that the most effective way to get people to respond was through Facebook. When she asked her friends if they would take the survey and pass it on to their friends or roommates she got a lot of responses. She also used email to survey her friends and classmates, which also worked pretty well. She found that people who knew her, even just as a classmate, were more likely to do the survey than strangers, but that even strangers would do it if they were asked by a mutual friend.In putting the survey results into the wiki, Rose discovered that the people who had done it before us had used many different formats, some of them not even putting their name or the date that the survey was conducted. This was a little inconvenient and she thought that it was a little confusing to have some survey results above ours, theirs without a date and ours with a date. Ultimately the group as a whole did the best we could to be consistent with the way that we were entering information into the wiki and fixed their formatting a little when it was possible.Candice chose to do her “G” surveys differently than everyone else in the group. She went to Books and Bytes café in Milne library and asked students she did not know to fill out her survey. This survey had the same basic components as the others with the exception of needing the person taking the survey to provide what they thought the definition of the word meant. Since she was not specifically answering questions it made it clear which words they did or didn’t recognize and which words may have been recognized if given the definition.Some of the surveys provided the definition of each term, while others asked the respondents to provide the definition. This produced definite differences in the accuracy and rate of responses. Words that were surveyed with the definition provided were more likely to be recognized. Surveys that asked for a definition received a lower response rate, and the definitions provided by respondents frequently missed the definition provided by the wiki. This was most frequent with common words that carry a slang connotation. Results for these surveys were edited based on whether the respondent provided an accurate definition; common, non-slang use of a word such as &quot;itch&quot; counted as a student who did not recognize the word. The members of “H-J” group also created different surveys from each other, based on their means of distribution. Joe Flynn created a survey consisting of all the words in his section of the wiki, with three columns for students to complete: have you heard this term? What does it mean? And have you heard it outside of Geneseo? Surveys were distributed electronically, never face-to-face. All of those students surveyed were either acquaintances or friends of acquaintances. This allowed students to take the survey at their leisure, which may have prevented hasty answers but which may also have diminished the response rate.            Survey results showed that the wiki contains a large amount of words which were considered obsolete by a majority of the students surveyed.  Other terms were posted with slang definitions which those surveyed did not recognize. Terms such as “hamster, “harsh,” “healthy,” or “itch” were recognized by the definitions by which they are commonly known rather than with any slangy connotation.            Beyond these, a majority of the words on the wiki are slang which the students surveyed considered to extend beyond the locality of Geneseo. “Hang,” “hook up,” and “Jew” are only a few of the terms that are part of a larger American English slang, with “Jew” arguably not being a slang term at all; 100% of students recognized both “hook up” and “Jew,” and 0% believed it to be Geneseo-specific. Most of these terms are in common because of their connection to drinking, drugs, sex, and other night life activities. Terms such as “have a cow” were cited by students to be specific references to American popular culture: in this example, the television show The Simpsons.            Most of the terms considered to pertain mainly to Geneseo are those that refer to specific Geneseo places, as in “IB” and “ISC,” or people, as in “Ice Knights” and “Herzmanite.” “Humans vs. Zombies” is a unique example. The game exists primarily on college campuses, with the result that 40% of the survey recipients have encountered it only in Geneseo. However, it is little known among students here that the game originated in Goucher College in Maryland, and that it is played across the United States.Sean Endress decided to conduct all of his surveys face-to-face, like Candice in the “G” group. This allowed him to clarify in the event that it was needed (“Itch”- “really, like, just an ‘itch’?” “Yeah really.” Vs. “So what do you mean by ‘herb’ anyway?”)But it meant that he didn’t need to include the definition in a way that might skew the results (if the definition is sitting there in front of them, a person might think they recognize a word when, in fact, they wouldn’t normally)A co of this choice being that it took a bit longer, but eliminated all survey confusion so data is as little affected by error as possible. This process was slow, but thorough. It tended to generate more “all or nothing” results in that results were very polarized, closer to 0 or 100.            The actual results were not very exciting, as they confirmed our group’s initial hypotheses.  Definitions for words such as “game,” “gamer,” and “ganja” were all found to be universal to the college community at large.  Additionally, the most universal definitions, as determined by this survey, were for “get laid” and “Guido,” with all of those surveyed knowing those definitions.  This indicates, or verifies depending on what your initial assumptions were, that universal college terms are most likely to be those associated with popular culture, as students now have unprecedented and constant access to television programs, films, music, and the creations of other college students via the Internet.Margaret and Megan were assigned the words beginning with letters K-M. Their survey addressed the four basic assessment categories created and used by the rest of the group, but in a different format that they tailored to their medium of distribution. The survey was changed from a grid format to a multiple-choice question format. Those surveyed were given instructions at the top of the survey, along with the four categories represented by multiple-choice letters. The options were listed as follows – A) I am aware of this word/definition combo; B) I am aware of this word/definition combo, AND have heard it outside the Geneseo community; C) I am aware of this word but not with this definition; D) I am not aware of this word. Questions for the words K-M were phrased in this style: Knightweb – Website that displays crucial information about academics, tuition, and it is the primary method of registration. A space was provided next to the bolded dictionary word for participants to write in the letter they thought best aligned with the word. For this example, 100% of those surveyed selected A for this word, suggesting that it is Geneseo-specific to an overwhelming majority.            The K-M survey was distributed via e-mail. The cross-section of participants spanned all four class years at Geneseo; both genders; and students involved in various clubs and organizations. Each word was surveyed by forty people. Surveys were both printed and returned to either Megan or Margaret, or completed in a word document and e-mailed back. Megan and Margaret compiled their results in an excel spreadsheet and used that to determine the percentages of word recognition and belief in local originOverall, our group found that the survey results generally aligned with our original designations of the words. With a few exceptions, the surveyed words fell into similar categories to those we had created in the first phase of our research. We expect this to happen. Within the group itself, our members, despite all being upperclassmen with some mutual background in English and/or Linguistics, displayed a varied cross-section of the Geneseo campus. The majority of our group members had not met each other before this class, mainly based on the differentiation in organizations and activities we engage in on campus. From our already varied backgrounds, we then each surveyed our words with forty or more students of an even more varied background. We were not surprised to find that the students who completed our surveys had similar exposure and understanding of these words to our group members. To us, it really demonstrated the impact of language over a large body of people. The majority of our words were either strongly known or strongly unknown; very few were only recognized or known by 50% of those surveyed. Despite the different backgrounds and livelihoods of Geneseo students, we all appear to have the same basic command of the lexicon that appears in the Dictionary of Geneseo English. Rose Goodwin: G-groupWordHave you been exposed to this word/definition?DefinitionHave you heard this word outside of Geneseo?GAGG Acronym for the Geneseo Area Gaming Group Gaitoring ''Verb'' (Recorded only as participle) by Delta Kappa Tau fraternity term for throwing beer and vomit on floor and sliding through it in small groups with arms locked together. Game adj. up for anything Example: “Do you want to go to class?
