Written Report Word Dictionary E-H

Introduction:  

This group, consisting of Caitlin Klein, Jayme Wonderland, and Megan Talbot began this project as an assignment from Dr. Drake's History of the English Language class.  First, the words which had been put on the internet by 2006's History of the English Language class had to be transferred to a new webpage, as the old one was closing.  The three of us analyzed the credibility of the pre-existing words.  Then, we opened our ears and notepads to collect new slang used by Geneseo students.  

Strategies:  

We began with the most tedious part of our task, copying and pasting the old dictionary to the new one. This was important mainly so that we would still have the previous words, but it also familiarized us with the words. This made it easier for us to see what words were not in the dictionary already, as well as learn definitions of words we were not used to so that we could better test them in our research. Many words seemed to us inappropriate for the dictionary. Proper nouns, like Ella Cline Shear School of Education, are Geneseo specific, but anyone can hear them and understand their meaning. Other words, such as Facebook, and verbs resulting from it such as to friend were more problematic. The inclusion of Facebook in the Wiki was for historical purposes. Although the lexicon that has begun to surround Facebook is now not strictly limited to college campus, not that long ago the network was only open to college students. The slang has permeated to groups outside of both Geneseo and college campuses. 

To begin the research part of the assignment we each sent out, via email, an initial survey that requested participants to respond to old words (whether they knew them or not, and if they've heard them in Geneseo) and to add new slang that was not on the list.  This technique did not bring the flood of responses that we had hoped for, though we did get about forty respondents, more than enough for a linguistic sample, which should consist of at least thirty subjects. Another online networking strategy that we utilized was a Facebook group. We made a &quot;Geneseo Vernacular&quot; Facebook group, but again the response we were hoping for did not result.

We also used random sampling, attending bars, club meetings, campus programs simply to hear people speak. In these settings we also engaged random individuals in conversation testing out words to see if people understood what was being said. Situations like this also allowed us to try and listen to new words. Conversations like this could happen in a bar, at a fraternity, or in a more scholarly atmosphere.  Typically, the more inebriated the interviewee was, the more colorful the words he or she came up with were.  Many words were specific to a particular friend group and were not accepted into the Geneseo Dictionary because they were not applicable or known to a large demographic.  These finding led us to many questions such as how many people must know a word to consider it a word, as well as the challenge of discerning words in our own language. 

Challenges:

As we already mentioned, we did not get the large response via email survey that we had hoped for. It was difficult to get people interested. This was also an issue in random sampling. People generally don't think about the words they use extensively. Words had to be introduced subtly. One subject swore that she did not know what was meant by the word Fives, though she can be heard using it on a daily basis. Out of context it did not make sense.

We also found that many words were simply not understood. Words like Erwinhead have truly become obsolete, only understood by H.O.T.E.L. students who have seen the dictionary and/or heard Dr. Drake's explanation of it.  Subjects could conjecture that it was related to Erwin, just as Herzmanite might have something to do with Herzman, which has also fallen out of use.

Although people did respond, in the survey, to the already existing slang, very few were able to come up with new words on the spot.  The trick to gathering slang seems to be to hear it in usage rather than grilling an unprepared victim.  Once a slang word was identified, sometimes the Geneseo student was more able to come up with more slang words of a similar meaning. 

Another difficulty with finding words to add to the Geneseo Dictionary was that we found ourselves having a difficult time noticing slang within our own vocabulary.  As college students ourselves, we speak amongst other college students with passing slang usage.  It was difficult for us to recognize words that we use on a daily basis as slang.  Once out of context, the word is easily recognizable as college slang, but it isn't always a simple task to pluck those words from our vocabulary.  What made a difference for Megan, in recognizing college slang, was going home and having a conversation with her Grandfather. She was able to see how our language differed, and from that Megan could pick out a few slang words in her vocabulary. Though this method was not always affective since we do use different registers depending on whom we are speaking with.

Findings:

Many of the words which were in the dictionary were found to be non-specific to the Geneseo area, although they did seem to pertain to the college student demographic.  Examples of this type of word are &quot;hoodie&quot; &quot;hurl&quot;.  They are words which pertain to a part of college life, not necessarily Geneseo's college life.

Many words seem to be simply out of use. About a fifth of the words in the survey were unrecognized by anyone and were equally unknown in face-to-face interviews.

One of the words that is in the dictionary from a previous edition is &quot;The Ellen Clein Sheer School of Education&quot;.  It has been determined amongst this group that that word is not slang at all, it is the name of a department of SUNY Geneseo.  It would be recognizable to those who are not college students or from SUNY Geneseo.  

Other words that existed in the 2006 version of the Geneseo Dictionary have become obsolete because the people and locations that they pertained to have since moved on.  For example, the word phrase &quot;house of ID&quot;, which referred to a specific apartment in the meadows which &quot;held gay parties&quot; is no longer functional since the occupants of said apartment have since moved on.  

We noticed that many of the words that we collected for the Geneseo Dictionary had dirty connotations.  Often they relate to drugs or sex, sometimes both.  Sometimes they were simply derogatory terms for other people.  These words spring up because society has put pressure on teenagers to avoid certain activities, and once college students come into their own, away from the structured households of their parents and start experiencing new and different things, the negativity on these activities still remains.  It is difficult for a young adult to speak directly about sex and drugs, so many new words evolve.  As a word becomes known by a large group of people, a new slang word develops to keep the exact meaning a little vague when someone talks about a taboo topic.  Take, for example, the word &quot;gerb&quot;, which means to vomit.  No one likes to hear much about that, so when a pale faced young partier grabs his friends before rushing to the bathroom and says &quot;I've got to gerb&quot;, only a select few will understand his true meaning, which is probably for the best.  Society frowns upon throwing up, so those who must come up with a colorful selection of words to avoid saying it explicitly.  

Conclusion:

While our research was limited, we do believe it was fruitful. It gave us an opportunity to look at Geneseo's past through its words, as well as learn a bit more about the present as we attempted to decipher new slang. With more time and resources, we may be able to discover depths to Geneseo discourse that are as of yet unknown, but for the moment we find that the meager Geneseo specific slang is constantly evolving. Much of what was no longer is, but that simply refers to the words, the ideas are still there and often create new words to describe them.
