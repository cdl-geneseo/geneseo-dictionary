Chelsea Pullano, Andrew Russo, Phil VanHarken  History of the English Language: Final Dictionary findings, S-Z  Wherever you go, each place seems to have its own language. Geneseo is no exception. A blend of people from Buffalo, Rochester, and Long Island, as well as some other New York areas, and the occasional student from out of state, come together in this space and mix, exchange, and create a language that is unique from any other setting. But like all other campuses, DMthe vocabulary changes with each incoming class. Not only do new words appear, but words become obsolete, and sometimes obsolete words a revived and once again become part of the language. The first aspect of Geneseo's vocabulary our group explored was new words that have appeared since the dictionary was last updated. The process of learning the new vocabulary in Geneseo was not as clear-cut as one would have imagined. We employed several methods to get an idea of what words were in circulation. Chelsea, with a group of friends, would go to brunch at Letchworth dining hall and note any new words she heard. She also used this method at sorority parties, and while simply walking around campus. Andrew explored a similar tactic, but in the bar setting, which was where the older section of the school populace gathered. Phil, our local, utilized his connections at RIT, MCC, and other SUNY schools as well as his friendships with senior leadership in Greek life. Once a new word was encountered, we would bring it back to the group and we would all use these same settings to test the word by asking people if they knew the definition of it. If a significant amount of people knew the definition of said new word, we determined that it needed to be added to the dictionary. This seems to be a good combination of random and targeted groups….Can you tell me what constituted a &quot;significant&quot; number of people? Some words that we added to the dictionary were words that have been well known in Geneseo for years. For example, ''Toga' is an abbreviation for the Saratoga Townhouses, buildings which have been on campus for years. Also, 'Sig Nu' is a well-known fraternity on campus, and the 'Statesman' is a bar on Court Street which has been open for a significant number of years. Another example of this is the term 'Welfare Wednesday,' which is the tradition of bars selling discount drinks on Wednesday nights. This practice, like the other words above, is not by any means new. It is not known why these were not previously included in the dictionary. It is possible that they were so well known that they were not considered when adding new words to the dictionary in the past, since they are not indeed new.  Other new words have obvious origins. These include 'University Hots,' which is a restaurant which was opened in Fall 2010. Likewise 'Sammys' refers to a fraternity that just gained college recognition this fall. These words were new to the Geneseo language because the things they referred to were new to Geneseo society. Others were conspicuously absent: 'stog,' for cigarette, 'tapped-out,' to express a lack of money, and 'Xanny,' a slang term for anxiety-reducing medication. We also encountered the term 'Sad Panda,' which originates from a South Park episode. While this term is not Geneseo- specific, it is a commonly used term, and its origins are clear.  We also encountered some new words that we are could not determine the origins of. These included 'Sassy,' meaning with attitude, 'Salted,' referring to clothes that have become bleached and stiff due to salt on the roads, and 'Squig,' which refers to a cup of water to drink while intoxicated. This final word was created by Andrew, and it caught on among the group he was with when he created it. From there it spread throughout the school. With this experiment, we discovered a possible explanation for the other words mentioned above. They could have been created at any time, and simply have caught on and spread throughout time.  The next aspect of the language our group examined was words that have become obsolete. To determine obsolete words, we first tested them among our friends and then among the general population. If a word was unfamiliar to the members of our group, we would decide it needed to be examined further. At this point we would all test the word among our friends, and see if they knew the definition. If a high percentage what was the threshold for this?of them did, it was decided that the word was probably still commonly used. However, if not many of our friends knew the definition, we would move on and ask other people. We surveyed people at the local bars, fraternity and sorority parties, local colleges, and at Sunday morning brunches in Letchworth Dining hall. Depending on how many of these people knew the definition of the word, we would determine whether it could be considered obsolete or not. We never decided on a specific percentage of people to base these findings onoff of, but the surveys always displayed obvious results, with almost all of the students surveyed yielding the same results, so this was not a problem.  We found nine words that had become obsolete since the dictionary had last been updated. Many of these entries were not specific to Geneseo, and probably became obsolete simply because they, or the things they were referring to, went out of style. For example, the term 'suck and blo' referred to a card game which is no longer well known among the college population, and the word 'stylin'' was a word that simply fell out of use as people began finding other words to describe being fashionable. Another example of this is the habit of adding '-sk' to the end of words, which has evolved into simply adding an '–s.' Other words are more Geneseo-specific, and the reasons that they became obsolete aren't necessarily clear. The best possibility seems to be that the students who were here when the words were most popular have graduated, and the popularity of said words was never transferred to the underclassmen. These words include 'Slam pig,' meaning a promiscuous woman, 'Shot off the boob,' meaning gone on a tangent, 'Sexexcellent,' which today has evolved into simply 'Sexcellent,' 'Shoots,' and 'Schmedium.'  Three words in particular have incorrect or incomplete definitions: 'Spliff,' 'Twisted,' and 'slam.' There are several explanations for these errors, and 'slam' seems the most obvious. The word carries a secondary and vulgar definition relating to sexual activity; this was most likely left out to avoid the awkward. In the case of 'Twisted,' it is highly likely that the definition has simply shifted to mean something slightly different. Instead of meaning &quot;drunk or on drugs,&quot; the term now refers to someone who is both drunk and on drugs and the disorienting feeling brought about by the combination. Finally, 'Spliff' is just incorrectly defined. The original entry defines it as a filter for a marijuana cigarette and quotes Bob Marley when talks about &quot;lighting my spliff.&quot; As one of the most iconic marijuana consumers in history, it is unlikely that Bob Marley lit his joints backwards, beginning with the filter. Correctly defined, a spliff is a hand rolled cigarette containing a mixture of strong tobacco and marijuana. These three words evidence incorrect usage, omitted definitions, perhaps for the sake of propriety, and emerging definitions as seen in the shift of 'Twisted.' Possibly the most interesting finding for this group was the discovery of a word that went from being obsolete to being used frequently again. The phrase 'Special Talent' had been marked obsolete in Fall 2006. However, when reviewing the list of words, our group decided to test it, because members of the group had heard it used. We tested it in the same manner described to determine if words should be marked as obsolete, and our findings were quite interesting. 'Special Talent' is commonly used to describe a person who got into Geneseo for sports and who is less intelligent than the average student here, and therefore requires tutoring. Our group has not been able to determine what led this word to cease being obsolete, although we have formed some hypotheses. Foremost is the rising sensitivity to the term 'special' in connection with low intelligence, the contributor may have been acting to appear culturally sensitive. Alternateley, the group that marked it obsolete may have done so prematurely, or maybe there is currently a higher amount of students that are described by this phrase than there were in 2006. While we cannot be sure why it was dropped, we are sure that the phrase is a commonly used term on Geneseo's campus. Relatively speaking, the S-Z section of the alphabet has seen a good amount of vocabulary change. While 28 additions and changes may seem relatively small, it is actually quite impressive. These changes have emerged as empirically viable and observable in only two years, from 2008 to 2010. This is evidence of the fact that Geneseo's small campus allows for much more rapid linguistic development than a larger school, or indeed, the general population. Tracking this dictionary project and actively participating in it helps students to see themselves as part of a vocabulary that is built on, and evolving around, their own lives.  This report is strong in the copious examples of results you got from your research. I would also like to know a little more, as I've indicated, about qualitative decisions you made about numbers and how you reached these decisions. Again, I think you did do a good job of combining specific groups with random aggregates of people, and you do a good job of testing and reporting on obsolete expressions.
