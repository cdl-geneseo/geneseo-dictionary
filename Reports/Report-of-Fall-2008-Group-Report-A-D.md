Introduction: 

In regards to language, a unique environment will yield a unique lexis.  Thus is the case with the use of English on the SUNY Geneseo campus. Sharing in all of the aspects of Standard English, this difference in lexis is what sets the use of English at Geneseo apart from the Standard dialect.  The distinctiveness of this lexis necessitates the need to chronicle and document it.  By investigating the lexical items that comprise Geneseo English, the patterns of use and disuse, and the categorization of the terms identified, we are able to witness the lexis that has evolved.  Though some words have evolved to be used in the broader scale of College English, much of the lexicon developed truly originates from and are used in Geneseo English.

Strategies:

In order to collect the most relevant data regarding the lexis of Geneseo lexis, a variety of methodologies were utilized.  These methodologies allowed for us to work efficiently and to survey a diverse portion of the Geneseo student body.  Our first method was to divide the existing dictionary entries amongst us so as to investigate how the usage of these entries has changed over the two years that have elapsed since the last survey was performed.  Students were surveyed in order to determine their familiarity with past entries.  These surveys included online questionnaires, face to face interviews, and paper questionnaires.  Each of these tools allowed for us to identify the words that have continued to be used or have fallen or are falling out of use.  The next aspect of our investigation required us to identify any neologisms that have emerged into Geneseo English since the last survey was undertaken.  The methods incorporated to accomplish this task were similar to those utilized in assessing the student familiarity with past terminologies. Face to face interviews, paper surveys and electronic questionnaires were all utilized.  In addition to these, we also were prepared to find terms in less formal situations such as everyday speech with friends, overheard conversations, e-mails, and printed materials.  After acquiring new terms, individuals were interviewed in order to define and document the usage of the term.

Challenges:  

There were many obstacles we faced in trying to collect and test word usage on campus.  One of the biggest struggles was deciding what sample size was an appropriate sample size and then achieving that sample size.  Obviously it is impossible to reach every Geneseo student and receive feedback which makes the goal of creating an entirely complete dictionary unattainable. Moreover, the inability to obtain input from a large sample, regardless of methodology, makes it harder to declare words as obsolete. While there were many words that we found to be obsolete, there is a strong possibility that our surveys did not reach students who use certain terminology.  One example of a word found to be obsolete was &quot;Doy-Doy: a reference to a noun of laughably poor quality or to an awkwardly (or poorly) accomplished action. &quot;That doy-doy coffee pot makes more steam than coffee.&quot; &quot;First he tripped on the floor board and then he fell over the chair. That was a doy-doy move.&quot; This term probably came from the word &quot;doy&quot; or &quot;duh&quot; which are derogatory words indicating mental retardation&quot;  because the previous contributors of this word did not record percentages of usage we cannot determine if the lack of popularity is from a flaw in our methodology or the result of an already disappearing word.  Another difficulty we encountered was the actual collection of words.  We found that it was hard for people to spontaneously provide us with new words present in their vernacular at Geneseo because they are not always conscious that they are even using Geneseo or college specific language. 

Findings:

One of the first themes we discovered was that Geneseo slang is often vulgar and raunchy.  A large portion of the lexis relates to alcohol consumption and sexual activities of the mundane and deviant varieties.  For example: &quot;Civil War: Noun: A variant of beer pong with teams of 3 each with 6 cups; &quot;I'm bored of regular pong let's play some Civil War.&quot;&quot;, &quot;Bump uglies: Verb- To have sex. &quot;Me and my girl are gonna bump uglies tonight.&quot;&quot; and &quot;Completing the Rainbow: noun- the successful gathering of all possible &quot;stripes&quot; by a sorority sister, having successfully had sex with at least one member of each fraternity or men's sports team on campus.&quot; Even more socially unacceptable is the term &quot;Cleveland Steamer (NN): sex act in which one partner defecates on the other partner's chest.&quot;    

Conclusions:

Making a dictionary is a time consuming task if it is taken seriously and professionally.  The process relies heavily on the support and cooperation of the community, as well as strong methods of data collection.  In order to generate a dictionary that is representative of the college community as a whole, an endeavor into documenting the lexis must be done using a sample of all sub groups that the population consists of.  Though a necessary aspect of a dictionary, this investigation into all of the subsets of the student body would require far more time and effort than can be allotted in a single semester.  Considering time constraints on our part, the information yielded from our investigation provided useful  and relevant insight into the use of the English language at Geneseo.
