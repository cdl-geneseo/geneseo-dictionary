Dr. Drake History of the English Language Alicia BELLIARD Kat CHAPMAN       Wiki Project Letters A-F Report 2010       Starting points: One of the questions we asked while surveying Geneseo students was: &quot;Where have you heard this word? Is it a term you only hear and eventually use in Geneseo?&quot; To that, most of them would insist that the word in question was not a Geneseo term. But what truly is meant by &quot;Geneseo word&quot;? Let's try to give a definition to it. By Geneseo word, we mean a word which developed itself in Geneseo (not necessarily created there), that most of the SUNY Geneseo population knows about (let it be the staff or the students), a word which somehow creates a sense of the Geneseo identity.  Our profile as students (me being a French exchange student and Kat being a student living off-campus) did not make the task of uploading and editing the wiki dictionary the easiest task in the world. However, our &quot;external&quot; look at upon the lexis of Geneseo allowed us to realize how revealing of its population language truly is. We soon realized we had to go farther than our immediate companions and habits and get away from what we were familiar with to be able to report faithfully the Geneseo student body as a whole. At first we really focused on surveying students who had experienced the life in Geneseo for more than a semester, which excluded my international friends and Kat's friends since most don't attend Geneseo. But our results led us to realize that each each single Geneseo students could influence in many ways and shape Geneseo's lexis.  This did give you both a special and useful outsider status, though of course you're also inside to a degree, since you are both Geneseo students.  Procedure: We created paper surveys that we handed out to people we did not necessarily know from everywhere around campus. We were concerned in representing the diversity of Geneseo and therefore tried to survey students every age and coming from every majors (pre-med, English, to Art History, Geography or Chemistry). The survey included a list of words with definitions we took from the existing Geneseo Wiki Dictionary and questions related to the words. The surveyed students were asked if they had heard the word before, how frequently they were hearing it or using it, if they knew a different meaning to it and eventually if they believed it was either a Geneseo word or a word they could hear anywhere else. Most our statistics are based on these surveys, also we realized had a lot of trouble (just like us) putting a finger on the words they were increasingly using ever since they arrived in Geneseo. Many of the surveys we returned incomplete or only revealed most the updated words to be obsolete. We did however get some interesting inputs like the verb &quot;brainfart&quot; which a friend gave me as I was struggling to find my words, but most those inputs were already in the dictionary.  I would like to see an example of such a survey.  Results We had a few original terms from the surveys, some of the words like &quot;dick-tease&quot; or &quot;bitch-ass&quot; are words some of the Geneseo students use on a regular basis for fun and which many others would no doubt be able to recognize. However, they are not really representing the school as a whole but mainly how diverse and plural Geneseo has become. Students come here from all over, and bring their favorite terms with them. We added some words that were blatantly missing from the dictionary, such as popular buildings and associations on campus. This was an important addition that several groups made. We added the word &quot;cake&quot; for &quot;effortless or nearly so&quot;, but were unable to find anyone still using &quot;cream cheese&quot;, a 2004 term meaning the same thing.  The new additions we were able to find were mostly places and building that really represent Geneseo (Big Tree Inn for example), but also cultural club names which are a full part of Geneseo students' vocabulary (CCC, BSU). Also, our own created word &quot;Drakeling&quot; would surely be understood by most people who have taken a class with Doctor Drake. In a way, those word seem to be true Geneseo words since they would not be understood the same in any other universities, they represent Geneseo. Analysis/ Conclusion Although updating the dictionary was difficult, it shows the local language is definitely changing. Our work also showed something that most Americans know well, that slang is a shifting, nebulous thing, fully understandable in one time and location, and completely incomprehensible in a different time and place. Slang spreads and flows through the country, sometimes dying out, sometimes becoming an &quot;official&quot; part of the language. It is a great thing to have a record of such localized words. Even though the language is changing slowly, someday it will likely be necessary to have such records to really &quot;know&quot; what the culture of Geneseo was in the early part of the third millennium.  You do basically explain your method and your findings; while that's good, it would be a good idea to enrich your report with more examples and details. I would also like to see more evidence of testing words already in the dictionary as well as adding new words to it.  GROUP GRADE FOR DICTIONARY PROJECT:  B+
