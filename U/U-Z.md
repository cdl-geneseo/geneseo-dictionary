To add an entry to the U-Z pages of the dictionary, click Create on the menu bar above. Use the word you're defining as the name of the page. Type your definition in the edit box, check your work by clicking Preview, and when you're done editing click Save. To edit an entry that has already been added to the U-Z pages, go to the page for that entry, click Edit, make your changes, and click Save. As pages are added, links to them are automatically added below. Do not edit the present page.
