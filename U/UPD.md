# UPD

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified by  Heather Heckman on May 06, 2022

(noun) Acronym for &quot;University Police Department&quot;&quot;If you climb a tree on campus after dark someone will call UPD thinking that you're drunk.&quot;UP (noun) Acronym for University Police.&quot;Stop acting like such an idiot, UP is up the street.&quot;

Comments:

Without being used in context, about 90% of those we surveyed recognized the correct definition of this term. This is probably not Geneseo-specific. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)

The results of our survey found that &quot;UP&quot; has become obsolete with 42 respondents never hearing it, and 2 respondents having it as part of their everyday usage. From observation and discussion among team members, we found that &quot;UPD&quot; is quite commonly used in speech and text. The meaning has stayed the same while the spelling and pronunciation has changed. (H. Heckman, S-Z, 2022)
