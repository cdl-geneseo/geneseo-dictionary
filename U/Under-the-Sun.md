(noun) The college bookstore where you can buy school supplies and Geneseo merchandise, located in the College Union.&quot;If you're going to Under the Sun, could you pick up a few blue books for me?&quot; Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. FNeveldine.Not sure that this this still in use, as the bookstore doesn't go by this name anymore. 4/12 students in a survey said they knew the phrase but were unable to define it. M.
