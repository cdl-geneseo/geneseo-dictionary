# Upvote

Created by  Unknown User (mtr7) on Apr 28, 2015

Yik Yak has an anonymous voting system for their anonymous posts.  You can either positively vote with an &quot;upvote&quot; or negatively vote with a &quot;downvote&quot;.  &quot;I was so surprised when I saw that I got 120 upvotes on my yak, I was drunk when I wrote it!&quot;.  Romig, S-Z, 2015.
