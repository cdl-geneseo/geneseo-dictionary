# Upvote

Created by  Unknown User (mtr7) on Apr 28, 2015

Yik Yak has an anonymous voting system for their anonymous posts.  You can either positively vote with an &quot;upvote&quot; or negatively vote with a &quot;downvote&quot;.  &quot;I was so surprised when I saw that I got 120 upvotes on my yak, I was drunk when I wrote it!&quot;.  Romig, S-Z, 2015.

Upvote is a term used on Yik Yak, a popular anonymous social media app widely used among students at SUNY Geneseo. An upvote refers to a positive tally given to a post, boosting its visibility and status on the feed. Students could either upvote or downvote anonymously, creating a kind of digital applause or disapproval for content that ranged from clever jokes about the Sturges steps to drunken confessions from nights out on Court Street.
