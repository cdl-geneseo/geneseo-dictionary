The Undergraduate Alumni Association, often abbreviated as UAA, is a student-run organization at SUNY Geneseo dedicated to fostering connections between current students and alumni. By maintaining networks that extend beyond graduation, the UAA helps preserve the strong sense of community for which Geneseo is known, whether through mentorship programs, alumni panels, or career networking events. The organization plays a key role in ensuring that the traditions, stories, and values that define the Geneseo experience continue to shape new generations.
