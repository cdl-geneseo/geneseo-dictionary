# Uggo

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 02, 2008

(noun) An ugly person. Popularized by the TV show &quot;Scrubs.&quot;

&quot;Eww, what an uggo! Someone get him a paper bag for his head!&quot; 

Comments:

Probably due to &quot;Scrubs&quot; having ended approximately a decade ago, the term has fallen out of use. It is still somewhat recognizable with nearly 14% of respondents using it frequently. Almost 50% of respondents had never heard the word, and by the next dictionary update, it will likely by obsolete. (H. Heckman, S-Z, 2022)
