Bibliographies and Study Guides : YOLO

Created by  Kayla Stewart on May 04, 2023

(acronym) 1. Stands for “you only live once” typically used as a term of encouragement. 2. A popular phrase that encourages people to take risks and live life to the fullest.Example: &quot;I decided to book the spontaneous trip to Europe because, as they say, YOLO!&quot; (Stewart, S-Z, 2023) 

Comments:

According to the surveys, 100% of the participants knew of this term. While the term was initially popular among younger people, its use has since declined somewhat in recent years. Some students may still use the term as a catchphrase or as a way to justify impulsive or risky behavior, others may view it as outdated or corny. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)
