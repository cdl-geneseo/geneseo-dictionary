Comments:

YouBelong's logo's slogan states: &quot;count during your first semester.&quot;  YouBelong was created as a meet and greet for new transfer students while serving their needs as students new to campus.  It holds dinners and advisement sessions as well as giving out tee-shirts to create a community atmosphere.  In 2010 it won an award as an outstanding program.EOberdorf, 2012
