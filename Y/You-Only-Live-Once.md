# You Only Live Once

Created by  Unknown User (eo7) on Nov 16, 2012

interj., n. &amp; v. You use this phrase when taking risky actions. &quot;I’m going skydiving without a parachute! You only live once!&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

Most people when saying &quot;You only live once&quot; shorten it and say &quot;YOLO&quot;, the phrase is basically another &quot;carpe diem&quot;. (L.Rumfola S-Z 2012)

This is a great addition, it would definitely be recognized by 100% of Geneseo.  I'd also suggest adding &quot;YOLO,&quot; which is probably used more commonly. (McNiffe, N-R. 2012)
