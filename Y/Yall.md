# Y'all

2019:(contraction, plural noun). unpunctuated: you all, similar to &quot;you guys.&quot;&quot;How have y'all been?&quot;Medina, S-Z, 2019

Comments:

A Southern US term appearing among an overwhelmingly Northeast US student body continues to mystify me. Would some aspect of popular culture account for this usage? People at Geneseo may indeed use this, but surely it can't be in common use, even if people know what it means.
