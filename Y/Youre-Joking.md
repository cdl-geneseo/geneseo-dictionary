# You're Joking

Phrase. Something you say to show that you are surprised by what someone has said, or do not believe it is true. Commonly used among college students as they are yapping, with 69% of Geneseo students surveyed saying they hear or use the word very often and 23% saying somewhat often, with only 8% answering that they never come to interact with the word. Similar expressions include are you kidding and no way! (Smith, S-Z, 2024)
