While not an independent word, this suffix is quite common.  It generally denotes &quot;possessing the quality or characteristic of&quot;, with an additional connotation of uncertainty or indefiniteness.  For example, when someone is &quot;tired-ish&quot;, they display the characteristics of being tired, but are not known positively to have slept poorly. As of 2012, 90% of students surveyed know this suffix. 0% believe it is of local origins.(Endress, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

The pronunciation of this suffix determines its meaning. If there is a significant pause between the word and the suffix (ex. blue... ish), then the suffix is intended to convey doubt or uncertainty. Without the pause, the suffix retains its original meaning of characterization (ex. bluish).
