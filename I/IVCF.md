N., abbrev. Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. Religious organization of students on campus affiliated with Christianity, dedicated to meeting in small and large groups for prayer and discussion.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 2006, Marcantonio.As of 2010, 0% of students surveyed know the word. This word is either obsolete or limited in usage.(Fishkin, G-M, 2010)As of 2012, 85% of students surveyed know this word. 35% believe it is of local origins.(Endress, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

It seems odd that in 2010, zero percent of students would recognize the name of one of Geneseo's largest organizations. Perhaps there was an error? 2012 polling conformed more with expectations.
