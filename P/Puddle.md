Comments:

Puddle- (n.) Someone who consumes a large amount of alcohol and/or weed. Essentially leading them to just sit or lay the whole party, not doing anything. “Damn man, you were a puddle last night”  (Bharucha, N-R, 2020) This term received a 1 on a frequency scale from 1 to 3. (1 being unfamiliar, 3 being very familiar)
