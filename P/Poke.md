Comments:

As of 2012, the definition of this word has changed drastically. &quot;Poke&quot; is a verb for when one &quot;pokes&quot; someone else on facebook, or a noun, as the name for the &quot;poke&quot; message you received from that person.Ex. (v.) He poked me on facebook last night, does that mean he wants to talk?Ex. (n.) I got like 5 pokes from him last night, and it turned into a poke-war.Â This word, with the new definitions, received a 3.1 out of 5 on student surveys, a 1 being an unknown word and a 5 being a word frequently used and heard. Also, the word is probably not Geneseo specific, because facebook is so popular.(Miller, N-R, 2012)
