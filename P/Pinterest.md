n. The name of the website that is used to reblog images. Ex. The house on this website is so cool, I'm going to post in on my Pinterest.As of 2012, this word received an average of 3.42 out of 5 on student surveys, 1 being an unknown word and 5 being a word commonly used and heard.(Miller, N-R, 2012) 

Comments:

Given the flash in the pan life expectancy of many websites, it will be interesting to see if this word is still used the next time it's surveyed. (Craft, G-M, 2012)
