# Pass out

Created by  Unknown User (era6), last modified on Sep 16, 2008

Pass out

(adj.) to be unconcious from beer or other drugs; &quot;Yeah, I think your phone's under Frank. He's passed out on the couch.&quot; Submitted 2001. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pass+out ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Bates.

Comments:

While interviewed students did immediately associate this term with drinking they also mentioned it as referring to being tired. Interestingly, once many students thought of the term in reference to being tired they backtracked and said that they personally probably wouldn’t use it to refer to a drunk person—though clearly that association is still a relevant one. (Wilcoxen, N-R, 2015).
