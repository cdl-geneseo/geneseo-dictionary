# Pace

Created by  Unknown User (gmm6), last modified by  Unknown User (ram19) on Nov 20, 2012

(interj.)  A farewell statement.  Also, a variation of &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;peace out&quot;; &quot;I better get going.&quot;  &quot;Alright, pace.&quot;  Similar definitions can be found in the Urban Dictionary.  Usage not specific to Geneseo.  Martinelli, N-R, 2010. Obsolete as of Fall 2012 (Miller, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

This word received several different definitions in our survey. Many students used the standard definition of &quot;To pace oneself.&quot; However, due to the inconsistencies in the definitions and the fact that very few surveys, if any, reported the above definition, the word was marked obsolete. (B. Joyce, 2012)
