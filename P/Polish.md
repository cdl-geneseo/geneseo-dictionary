Polish

(adj.) Refers to something or someone that is stupid. &quot;This assignment is so Polish.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1999. Obsolete 2006. Adams.

Comments:

The provenance of the term lies in popular prejudices and humor which holds that Polish people are less intelligent, whence the common &quot;Polish jokes&quot;.Â  A variant might be &quot;Polak&quot; or &quot;Polack&quot;, which refers specifically to a person. KKirkman, 24Nov08
