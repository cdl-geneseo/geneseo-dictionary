Noun: A person who is sexually interested in other people regardless of gender including males, females, transexuals, transvestites, hermaphrodites and androgynous people.  Example: Jesse is a pansexual. Geneseo usage shows significant decrease as of Fall 2010 with 55% of people surveyed reporting this word as unfamiliar or obsolete. Obselete as of Fall 2012 (Miller, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Although the word is considered obsolete within the general community, &quot;pansexual&quot; is a well-known term within the LGBTQA community. It may rise in popularity, as the distinction between bisexual and pansexual has begun to change in recent LGBTQA discussions.

The word has gained traction since 2012. It now refers more so to an individual who experiences sexual attraction to all sexes / gender identities, and sometimes implies having no gender preference in regards to romantic and / or sexual attraction and relationships.
