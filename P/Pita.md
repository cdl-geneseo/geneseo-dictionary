Pita

(/pit/, not pi ai ti e/ suggested from spelling): (n.) Acronym from Pain in the Ass; annoyance. &quot;He's in such a bad mood, he's being a Pita.&quot; F92, but not known to all Geneseo students then. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Obsolete Fall 2006. Adams.
