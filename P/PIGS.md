PIGS

(n.) Nickname for the Order of the Orange Knights, non-Greek organization. &quot;Do you know who is orientating for the PIGS (the Order of the Orange Knights) this semester?&quot; S95; acronym-like spelling (all capitals) not accounted for. Organization disbanded in 2009. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. Adams. Obsolete Fall 2010. Hanson.

Comments:

It seems that there might be a correlation between when this term became obsolete and the incident which caused them to be disbanded. The death of a student related to this organization occurred in 2009, the group was told that they could no longer function as an organization. It clearly took a little time for the use of the word to diminish.Â
