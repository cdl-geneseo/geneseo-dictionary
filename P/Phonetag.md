Phonetag

(n.) Failed attempt to reach someone in person on telephone because of answering machine interference; &quot;John, I keep getting this machine! We have to stop playing phonetag like this!&quot; S94; said to be S92, but no evidence given. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=phone+tag ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Bates.

Comments:

Not used frequently among younger generations, students agree that this word is outdated although they are able to understand its meaning (Frink, N-R, 2015).
