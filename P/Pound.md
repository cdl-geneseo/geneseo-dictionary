Pound(v.) To chug an alcoholic beverage. &quot;You better pound that drink, pussy.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1999. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/ ; entry probably not specific to Geneseo. Adams. (Littman, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

As of 2022, &quot;pound&quot; is still in use among Geneseo students, averaging a score of 3.7 out of 5, with 1 representing a word unknown to Geneseo students and 5 representing a word used daily among students. &quot;Pound&quot; was also surveyed as a noun to describing a drinking game with dice. However, data showed this alternative definition wasn't used often enough to be added, averaging a score of 2.8. (Schlau, N-R, 2022)
