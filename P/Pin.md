# Pin

Created by  Unknown User (ram19) on Nov 20, 2012

(v.) To post images on Pinterest.Ex. I pinned a ton of different hairstyles today.(Miller, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Still widely used in terms of Pinterest. Other definitions may include the act of pinning someone down, or a badge one wears on clothing (Frink, N-R, 2015).Â
