# Puff puff pass

Created by  Unknown User (afl1), last modified by  Unknown User (ssw2) on Apr 28, 2015

(v.) A term used for when several people in a circle pass a smoking device containing marijuana.(Littman, N-R, 2012) Obsolete, 2015. Wilcoxen.

Comments:

This definition was somewhat incorrect to begin with - puff puff pass more refers to the etiquette of taking 2 hits and passing it to the next person, not just people passing a smoking device around.
