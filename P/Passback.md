Passback

(n.) identification (driver's license) belonging to bar patron of legal age given over to underage drinker. &quot;You'll never get into the bar with that picture - you should get a passback instead.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. Obsolete Fall 2006. Bates.

Comments:

I have heard this term many times used by multiple different people in order to describe the action of passing a driver's license ID back to the person behind you so that they may get into a bar.  In this way, I think I would add the verb definition of passback as well.  (Littman, N-R, 2012).
