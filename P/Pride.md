# Pride

Created by  Unknown User (ssw2) on Apr 28, 2015

(n.) A club at Geneseo which is focused on the LGBTQ+ community. “Pride put on a great event last night.” Geneseo specific. (Wilcoxen, N-R, 2015)

Comments:

Although this word did not test specifically well without context, once context was added and students were interviewed it was understood as defined above almost every single time. This word is an extremely popular part of the Geneseo community and is widely recognized in this community.  (Foley, N-R, 2015)
