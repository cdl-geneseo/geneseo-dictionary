Created by  Unknown User (ram19), last modified on Nov 20, 2012

v. To sneak into someone else's photo, either on purpose or by accident. Ex. Maybe I shouldn't have photobombed their wedding pictures....n. The image of someone in the background of a photo who wasn't supposed to be there. Ex. I can't believe you were behind us, nice photobomb!As of 2012, students surveyed gave it an average of 3.93 out of 5, 1 being an unknown word, and 5 being a word they hear and use often.(Miller, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Students interviewed agree that although they understand the meaning of this word it is much less frequently used. Some predict it will become outdated within the next couple years. This word is more often heard being used by older generations as they pick up slang more slowly than the younger generations (Frink, N-R, 2015).
