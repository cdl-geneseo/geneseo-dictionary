# Putnam

Created by  Unknown User (gmm6), last modified on Sep 30, 2010

(n.)  An abbreviation that is used to refer to the Putnam Residence Hall.  &quot;I'm heading over to Putnam.&quot;  Martinelli, N-R, 2010.

Comments:

While this definition is certainly still in use, it is worth mentioning that many Geneseo students would refer to Putnam as ‘Eco House.’ (Wilcoxen, N-R, 2015).
