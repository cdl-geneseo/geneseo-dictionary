# WT, WTP

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 01, 2008

(noun) White Trash or White Trash Posse.

2008: Although &quot;white trash&quot; is still used as a term, &quot;WT&quot; or &quot;WTP&quot; were unrecognizable and obsolete.

Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. SHelsher. 

Comments:

It doesn't come up too often, but I think &quot;WTP&quot; is still used, and would often be recognized if taken in context. (McNiffe, N-R, 2012)
