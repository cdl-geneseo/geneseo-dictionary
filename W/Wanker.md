(noun) Idiot.

&quot;He's a real wanker.&quot;

Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. Nicodemi.Â  

Comments:

The term originates from British vulgar slang, meaning simply &quot;a person who masturbates.&quot; The British version is certainly abusive, but it's interesting that the American version would make such a blatant jump from meaning. Instead of making fun of someone for doing something we've simply adopted it to get straight to the point.This is an absolutely recognizable word, but as a student I can't claim to have ever heard a peer use it. I wouldn't deem it obsolete, mainly because it's a word that is still used around the world, but I don't think Geneseo students use it. Perhaps its generational slang, used often by our close predecessors and rarely by ourselves.I have seen and heard &quot;wanker&quot; used more often in literature and music than in conversation, and I assert that this is not nearly a Geneseo-specific phrase, but I still find it difficult to condemn it to being obsolete.RMyers, S-Z, 2012
