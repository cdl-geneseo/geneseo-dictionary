Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 01, 2008

(noun) Nickname for the Letchworth dining hall where &quot;letch&quot; is made &quot;wretch&quot;; implies that it is undesirable.

2008: Not defined as such unless given contextual clues; also referred to as &quot;Wretchworth&quot;.

Comments:

&quot;Wretchworth&quot; could qualify as aÂ  portmanteau word if it were certain that this is a combination of &quot;wretch&quot; and &quot;Letchworth.&quot; The word &quot;wretch&quot; by itself refers to a miserable person; but could there also be a homonymic overtone from the informal &quot;rech&quot; or &quot;recch&quot; (&quot;to vomit&quot;)?If &quot;t&quot; is the original portmanteau word, then &quot;wretch&quot; (with the meaning explained in the definition) would be a clipping of &quot;Wretchworth.&quot;
