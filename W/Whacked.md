(adj) Very tired, drunk, or stoned

&quot;Way too long a night...I'm definitely whacked.&quot;

2008: More popular is &quot;Whack&quot; (adj) messed up, not right. Used somewhat facetiously.

&quot;Did you hear he cheated on his girlfriend? ... That's whack.&quot;

According to our survey, over 50% of students had never heard of this term. Because of this, this term will likely become complete obsolete soon. (Ecija, S-Z, 2022)
