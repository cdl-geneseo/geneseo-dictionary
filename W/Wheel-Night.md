# Wheel Night

Created by  Unknown User (met10) on Apr 28, 2015

(Noun) Refers to the Thursday night promotion at the Idle Hour bar. Thursday nights from 10 pm to 2 am a wheel hanging from the bar ceiling is spun, and each section of the wheel corresponds to one of 16 drink specials. Every 15 minutes the wheel is spun again creating a new special drink.  M. Turner S-Z 2015
