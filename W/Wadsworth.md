n. Wadsworth Library. After surveys filled out by Geneseo students the word “Wadsworth” was a 1 on a familiarity scale with 1 being often used and 3 being never used. (Bell, S-Z, 2024)

Comments:

92.5% of people who were surveyed have heard of this word and could define it, and 4.8% of people have heard of this word but could not define it, thus it is still relevant. (Corbett, S-Z, 2025)
