Created by  Unknown User (alu1), last modified by  Unknown User (mtr7) on Apr 28, 2015

&quot;Weapons of Mass Distraction&quot;, slang term for large breasts. &quot;Check out the WMDs on that girl over there!&quot;None of the students we surveyed were able to identify what this acronym stood for.  Obsolete.  Romig, S-Z, 2015.
