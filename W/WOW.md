(noun) Acronym for Week of Welcome. The first week of the year, filled with events geared towards freshmen in order to make them feel like a part of the Geneseo community and meet new friends.

&quot;I thought I was going to miss my high school friends too much to have fun when I got here, but I met awesome people during WOW.&quot;
