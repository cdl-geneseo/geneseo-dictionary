# Wayne Manor

Created by  Unknown User (eo7) on Nov 16, 2012

n. A play on the name of a residence hall on campus and Batman’s alter ego’s home.&quot;Living in Wayne Manor makes me feel a little close to The Batman.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

In the wake of the Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, the fictional character of Batman has experienced a broadening of his fanbase. Batman's alter ego is Bruce Wayne which allows for a connection to be made between Wayne Hall and (Bruce) Wayne('s) Manor.EOberdorf, 2012
