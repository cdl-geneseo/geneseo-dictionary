WGSU refers to SUNY Geneseo’s campus radio station, pronounced as a single word rather than by its individual letters. Operated primarily by students, WGSU broadcasts a wide range of programming, from indie rock to talk shows, and serves as both a creative outlet and a professional training ground for those interested in media and communications. Deeply embedded in Geneseo’s campus culture, the station has long been a place where students express their voices, curate music, and connect with the broader community.

In a study done to determine of students know this word, about 41.7% know the word and can define it. About 25% were familiar with the word bout could not define it. 33.3% of students did not know the word at all.
