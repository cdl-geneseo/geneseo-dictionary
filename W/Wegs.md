(noun) Nickname for Wegman's Supermarket.&quot;I'm running up to Wegs, do you need anything?&quot;2023: Interestingly, while about 75% of people recorded that they recognized the term, 64% indicated that they never use the word. The remaining 36% recorded only using it sometimes. Based on usage patterns, the word may be fading into obsolescence. (Sweeney, S-Z, 2023)
