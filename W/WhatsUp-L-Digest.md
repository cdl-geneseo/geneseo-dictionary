Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Dec 01, 2008

(noun) Daily e-mail sent out by the school. It is a forum for different groups to announce upcoming events and activities. Also referred to as the &quot;WhatsUp List&quot;

&quot;I wasn't sure how to occupy my time until I checked the WhatsUp List - now I'm busy all the time!&quot;

Comments:

A change to this definition might be that it is &quot;an e-mail sent out to all students approximately every two to four days. It announces information about upcoming events and activities, which is sent to the list-serve by members of the college community, including both faculty and students.&quot; This digest is generally referred to by students as either the &quot;What's Up List&quot; or the &quot;What's Up E-mail.&quot; Usage is sometimes connected to some students' annoyance with the frequency of these e-mails and also the numerous issues that are often sent on the same day that contain different amounts of listings. However, some students' usage of this term is derived from an appreciation for the easy access to information about events on campus that this service provides. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
