Bibliographies and Study Guides : Walk of Shame

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified on Nov 24, 2008

(noun) The walk back to your dorm or apartment in the morning after a night of partying (due to one who passes out or hooks up.)

&quot;I had the worst walk of shame last week...I had to go from Ontario to 'Daga past a soccer game and a tour....in sweatpants and heels.&quot;

Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. Nicodemi. 

Comments:

This usually seems to connote a walk which is observed by other people, who generally comment on it after the subject is out of earshot.Â

So this is a question similar to &quot;If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&quot; If a gal walks home &quot;the morning after&quot; and nobody sees her, is it still a walk of shame?
