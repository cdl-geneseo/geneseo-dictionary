Bibliographies and Study Guides : Wind Tunnel

Created by  Unknown User (kmh28), last modified by  Jack Katz on May 07, 2022

(noun) The walkway between the Saratoga Townhouses that connects Southside to the academic buildings. Named for theÂ  gusts of wind that seem to exist only in this section.&quot;I swear, I'm going to start carrying an extra pair of gloves with me just to get through the Wind Tunnel - it's freezing in there!&quot;Thanks to Tom Cardot for the submission.

Comments:

36% of respondents indicated that they have never heard this word before meaning it has declined in usage since 2008. It is possible that &quot;wind tunnel&quot; is used only as an adjective to describe this area as opposed to a noun for the area of campus. (Katz, S-Z, 2022).
