&quot;Check webmail, the professor sent out our grades.&quot;

Comments:

This term will most likely be obsolete as SUNY Geneseo is changing its webmail provider to Gmail in the spring of 2013.  The term squirrelmail has been obsolete but recognizable for at least a year when Geneseo switched providers. EOberdorf, 2012

According to our survey, over 80% of surveyed students have never heard of this term, thus making it obsolete. (Ecija, S-Z, 2022)
