# Welles

Created by  Unknown User (eo7) on Nov 16, 2012

n. An academic building on campus.&quot;The English Department is housed within Welles.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

When referring to any building on campus, the &quot;descriptive&quot; section of its name is left out.  South Hall is not called &quot;South Hall,&quot; but is instead referred to as &quot;South.&quot;  In this same way, Welles Hall is called &quot;Welles.&quot;  This unspoken rule applies to any building regardless of its function: the MacVittie College Union is just &quot;The Union,&quot; residence halls as just &quot;Livingston, 'Daga, or Jones,&quot; and the Mary Jemison Dining Hall is &quot;MJ.&quot;  Shortened names are the tacit rule of Geneseo, although they are not limited to Geneseo.EOberdorf, 2012
