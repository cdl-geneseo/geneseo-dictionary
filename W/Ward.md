(n.) Refers to Ward street. Ward is a one way street that connects second street and main street. Ward has several housing options for students at Geneseo.Why don't we go up to Ward? There's usually something going on there.(Wall, U-Z, 2020)

Comments:

By &quot;options,&quot; I think we need to specify this a little more, especially for people outside Geneseo who have never seen Ward Street. Do &quot;options&quot; include  entertainment? parties and socializing? food? shopping?

Almost half of respondents have never heard this term before, only 10% of respondents use it regularly. (Katz, S-Z, 2022)
