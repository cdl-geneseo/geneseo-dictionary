Comments:

According to the survey, 84% of participants knew this term, 16% did not know this term. Some students may use this term to describe themselves and others, but it should be noted that there is a decline of the usage of this word. Many students may be familiar with the term &quot;wallflower&quot; through literature or pop culture references. For example, the novel &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky and the 2012 film adaptation. Many students may be familiar with and may use in certain contexts. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)
