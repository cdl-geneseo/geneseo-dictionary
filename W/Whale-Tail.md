(noun) Refers to a thong hanging out over jeans; (mostly) pertains to women. Derives from the shape of the thong; looks like a whale's tail sticking out of the water.

&quot;Look at the whale tail over there -- you'd think covering your underwear would be common sense. Guess not.&quot;

Thanks to Jayme Wonderland for the submission. 

Comments:

Most students who were surveyed has never heard of this term, thus making it somewhat obsolete. (Ecija, S-Z, 2022)
