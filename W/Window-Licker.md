(noun) Someone displaying seemingly below-average intelligence; acting like an idiot.&quot;Look at him purposely falling all over the place...what a window licker.&quot;Â (N) The word has fallen out of use, identifiable to only 14% of surveyed individuals. Terms with similar meaning and more common use include 'moron,' 'dumbass,' and other synonyms.Mary Wrynn. S-Z. 2019

Comments:

From the results of our survey, about only half recognized the correct definition. Urban dictionary has an entry for this term (found here http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=window%20licker), so it is probably not Geneseo specific. Judging from the connotations of the term, it is probably considered derogatory. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
