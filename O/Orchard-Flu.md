Orchard Flu: (n.) sickness transmitted from partying out on Orchard St. &quot;I think I got the Orchard Flu from drinking out of a random Solo cup.&quot; As of 2022, &quot;Orchard Flu&quot; is very familiar with Geneseo students, averaging a score of 4.1 out of 5, with 1 representing a word unknown to Geneseo students and 5 representing a word used daily among students.
