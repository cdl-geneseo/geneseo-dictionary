Comments:

Omega Grill was seized for failure to pay taxes in February of 2017, so that the word has since become obsolete is unsurprising.Here is an article from the Livingston County News on the seizure: https://www.thelcn.com/lcn01/omega-grill-seized-for-failure-to-pay-taxes-20170207(Rogers, N-R, 2019)
