n. A sexual encounter involving at least three persons. “When the ninth person joined the orgy it started to feel a little congested.” Horowitz 2012

Comments:

While this word is obviously not Geneseo-specific, 100% of students in this community were able to come up with the correct definition above. This is a word commonly associated with college culture and it should be to no surprise that is tested as well as it did. (Foley, N-R, 2015)

Unless &quot;orgy&quot; gets used in some other or possibly ironic way, or unless orgies are rather common at Geneseo or in national college life (maybe they are, I don't know!), this might not be a word that's specifically for the dictionary.
