(n.) a person who is over the age of twenty-one and therefore can legally gain entrance to bars and consume alcohol; “I can’t believe that Kelly got into the IB as an over last night; her fake ID is so bad.” Submitted 2010. Usage is specific to Geneseo. Hanson.(adj.) To be fed up with something, to no longer have interest in it; &quot;Don't worry about it, I'm over it.&quot; Anderson, N-R, 2015

Comments:

Although the word was tested in order to find if the noun &quot;over&quot; was obsolete or not, the majority of survey-takers defined it as an adjective. Enough students also defined it by the original definition, so we decided to keep the old one and add a second.
