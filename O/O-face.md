(n.) The face one makes during sexual climax. This phrase is not Geneseo specific. First used in the film Office Space, written and directed by Mike Judge (1999). &quot;I'm thinking I might take that new chick from Logistics. If things go well I might be showing her my O-face. 'Oh... Oh... Oh!' You know what I'm talkin' about. 'Oh!'&quot; Hanson. Obsolete 2019. (Rogers, N-R, 2019)

Comments:
