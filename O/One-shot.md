One shot

(v.) to chug a beer in one shot. &quot;Dude, one shot, you've got some catching up to do&quot;; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1998. Bates. Obsolete as of Fall 2010.

Comments:

When conducting personal interviews with this word, many defined this word as being &quot;Almost dead in a video game&quot;, such as Call of Duty, or Halo. This definition was not tested on a large scale and presumably would not test well. (Foley, N-R, 2015)
