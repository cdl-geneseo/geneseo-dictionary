Onion

(n.) MacVittie Student Union, particularly the dining area. &quot;It's pasta night at the Onion.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. Bates. Obsolete Fall 2010. A. Moak.

Comments:

While the definition above is locally-specific, many students (23 of 35) defined Onion as the popular satire-based news site. This definition would not be locally specific, but very popular among college culture like that of Geneseo. (Foley, N-R, 2015).
