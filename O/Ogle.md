Comments:

What was interesting about this word was that in personal interviews, 25 out of 35 (71%) students surveyed chose that this word had negative connotations behind it. This may have to do with the increased awareness on sexual crimes in college culture. (Foley, N-R, 2015)

Definition 1, when re-surveyed, was still obsolete, being used on a level of 1.67/5, with 1 reflecting the word never being used and 5 being constant use of the term. (Rogers, N-R, 2019)
