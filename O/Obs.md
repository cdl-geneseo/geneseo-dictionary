1. (adj.) (abbrv.) Used by History of the English Language students to express that a word is &quot;obsolete&quot;. &quot;How about the word 'nonpology?'&quot; &quot;Obs&quot;. A. Moak 2010 (Obsolete, 2012)(McNiffe, N-R, 2012)

Comments:

Although some History of English Language students may still use this term when working on this project, it is not used enough in the general Geneseo population to remain on this list. (B. Joyce, 2012)
