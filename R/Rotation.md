(v.) Passing a joint. &quot;Lets get the rotation going with this spliff.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2001. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rotation ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Dinki.  As of Fall 2010, 46% of the students surveyed were familiar with this term.  This may be attributed to the varying social communities that make up the student body.  Martinelli, N-R.

Comments:

Not specific to joints - any type of marijuana being passed around could be considered a rotation.
