# R. A. (superseded)

Created by  Unknown User (lav4), last modified by  Aurora Merwin on Apr 09, 2023

(n.) \r-a\ acronym for Resident Assistant dorm counselor. &quot;My roommate is so loud that I'm going to talk to my R.A. about switching rooms.&quot; F90. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ra ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. (Dinki)

Comments:

See unified entry RA (Umbrella Entry) to cover redundant entries &quot;R.A.&quot; and &quot;Ra&quot;. The meanings and definitions have not changed. (Merwin, N-R, 2023)Â
