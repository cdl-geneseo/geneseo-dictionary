# Retweet

1) v. to repost another person's "tweet" or post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.

2) interjection. used to express agreement or empahsis of someone's point in conversation, and especially for takes that may be controversial.  "MJ dining hall is better than Letchworth" "retweet." Of those surveyed, 91.3% ranked "retweet" as a 3 on a 3 point scale of familiarity, 1 being low and 3 being high.  (Totaro, N-R, 2024)

100% of people knew this word and could define it. This indicates that despite the social media platform’s name change from Twitter to X, the term retweet remains the same and in use. The sample was of 37 students (Emily M, 2025).
