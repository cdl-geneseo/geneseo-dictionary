(adj.) A statement or action which is seemingly out of context of a situation or conversation. Aquas Barbie Girl was kind of random for your party music mix. S94, said without evidence to be F93. In dictionaries applied to events. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=random ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.

This can also be used as an adjective for a person, as in &quot;She's so random.&quot;Â
