64.9% of people knew this word, while 18.9%  have heard it but could not define it. 16.2% had not heard this word. Given the data, the restaurant is falling out of popular knowledge among Geneseo students. This could be due to the recent location move of Rancho Viejo to a less visible location. The sample was of 37 students (Emily M, 2025).
