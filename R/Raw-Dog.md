As of 2022, the term 'raw dog' is also used to describe when you do something without knowing the outcome. An example of this being used is &quot;I'm just gonna raw dog this exam, I haven't prepared for it at all.&quot; A survey done in 2022 shows that this word is ranked an average of 4.2/5 (5 being everyday usage). This shows that there has been a resurgence of this word, despite it being declared obsolete a few years prior. However, this is likely due to the definition expanding.
