# Re-rack

Created by  Unknown User (gmm6), last modified on Nov 15, 2010

(vb.)  To request for a rearrangement of the remaining cups in a game of beer pong.  Usage is not specific to Geneseo.  Similar definitions can be found in the Urban Dictionary.  &quot;Our cups are too far apart.  Let's re-rack.&quot;  Martinelli, N-R, 2010.

Comments:

There are often rules related to how the remaining cups can be arranged as well as how many times they can be arranged per game. These rules are dependent on the house rules of wherever the game is being played.
