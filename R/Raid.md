# Raid

Created by  Unknown User (lav4), last modified on Oct 28, 2008

(v.) To bring sudden, surprising authoritative force to a situation &quot;Yeah, Jimmy got busted when his suite was raided by UP.&quot; (n.) the act of having done so. &quot;There was a raid at Jimmy's suite last night.&quot; Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=raid ; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo. Dinki.

Comments:

This is common, non-slang American English and probably does not belong in the Geneseo Dictionary.
