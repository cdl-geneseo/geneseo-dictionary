# Rot

v. to do nothing except lie in bed and do brainless activities such as watching TV or Tik Tok.  Akin to being a "couch potato."  One might say "I'm so tired I'm going to rot in bed for the rest of the day." Of those surveyed, 72.1% ranked "rot" as a 3 on a 3 point scale of familiarity, 1 being low and 3 being high.  (Totaro, N-R, 2024)
