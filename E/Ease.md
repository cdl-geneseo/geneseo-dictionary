# Ease

Created by  Mia Gennaro, last modified on May 03, 2023

(adjective) 1. Used to describe the level of difficulty of something, especially at the lower level, Ex. &quot;The class should complete this task with ease seeing as it is only review.&quot; 2. Used on social media in an ironic way to describe an activity, Ex. “Me and my friend are going on a walk… with ease.” (Gennaro, A-F, 2023)

Comments:

According to the survey, 88% of participants are very familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. This word is used frequently in Geneseo students vocabulary. It does have a more common meaning of describing a task, and a more modern version that is used on social media to show sarcasm of an action. It can be used in an ironic way to show how sometimes even the smallest tasks can be difficult. (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
