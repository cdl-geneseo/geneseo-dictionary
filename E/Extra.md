According to the survey, 100% of participants are familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. This word is used frequently in Geneseo students vocabulary. While it does have the standard meaning of describing a surplus of something, there is a more modern use of the word to describe the way an individual is acting. Both of these usages of the word are frequently used in present day. (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
