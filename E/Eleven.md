Comments:

Myself and many of my friends are unfamiliar with this term, it seems more popular among regulars of the bars and Greek Life. The drinking culture of college campuses is pretty uniform and friends at other schools have understood the game mentioned, so it's more of a college word than Geneseo.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
