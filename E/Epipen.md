Comments:

According to the survey, 80% of participants are familiar with this term, therefore the word is not obsolete. This word is not used frequently in Geneseo students vocabulary unless they come in contact with someone who has an allergy. People who are aware of this word are also informed on how to use this device in case on an emergency (Gennaro, A-F, 2023).
