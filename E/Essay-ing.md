Verb.  The action of writing an essay. Usage: &quot;What did you do today?&quot; &quot;Oh, I've been essay-ing all day long now, and I'm still not finished.&quot;Talbot, E-H 2008  Only 19% of participants correctly identified this word, usage is declining.   K. Andryshak, 2012

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants were familiar with the word, but could not define it; indicating that the word is not obsolete, but it is difficult to define. This may indicate that it is only used in conversation and it is not formal (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).

58% of the people surveyed did not know this word and 36% recognized it as meaning &quot;the action of writing an essay.&quot; This indicates that the use of the word is decreasing, but based on those who can define the word, the definition has not changed (Smith, A-F, 2022).
