Noun or Adjective [elf] A petite female nymphomaniac; &quot;All the guys like her because she's an elf.&quot; According to Spring, 2001, &quot;He's dating an elf.&quot; As found in the New York Times, September 10, 2000; &quot;'You know, I almost didn't come,' said Niki Botelho-Pabros, a 3-foot-6 performer who was dressed for the night in a leopard-print bikini top with leather dominatrix armbands and combat boots. Dragging on a Marlboro Light, Ms. Botelho-Pabros said: 'I thought it would be exploitative and I tend to stay away from that stimga type of elf and clown job.'&quot;

KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  While people did guess that &quot;elf&quot; meant a petite woman, nobody seemed to associate the word with sexuality. 

Comments:

At this point, an elf didn't have to refer to a woman, just a small person in general. I also had no sexual connotation. (Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is obsolete when referring to a sexual connotation (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
