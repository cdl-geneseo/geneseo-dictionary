Verb To enlarge or expand, Fall 2000. Usually employed to create a contrast with academia. &quot;My professor expects me to embiggen my paper because it's only three pages.&quot; Bound morpheme prefix &quot;em-&quot; (in) plus &quot;big&quot; plus derivational morpheme &quot;-en&quot; (verb maker).Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 2001 - Kocher 2006J.Boselli, 2012: Growing obsolete. Only 13% could identify the term.

Comments:

This word was actually coined by a writer on &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Apparently the fictional Springfield town motto is &quot;A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.&quot; Perhaps less popular is another word from the same episode: &quot;cromulent&quot; meaning valid or acceptable (based on context, at least.) I didn't realize that embiggen was so common. Ah, the power of pop culture!
