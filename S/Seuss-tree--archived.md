Comments:

&quot;The Dr. Seuss Tree&quot; is a common fuller form.

The actual form of this word is Seuss Spruce.  I think there was some sort of decision made at some level of the group responsible for tours that tour guides would only use that form of it.  Also, it rolls off the tongue much more nicely. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z, 2012)
