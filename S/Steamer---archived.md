Steamer: (noun) 1. human excrement &quot;I gotta take a steamer before our lacrosse game.&quot; 2. A steamed milk beverage at The Campus Grind. &quot;My this Swedish Steamer is delicious.&quot;A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=steamer for the first definition; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.
