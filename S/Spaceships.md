n. The rolling chairs in Welles Hall.&quot;Rolling around in a spaceship is better than sitting at a desk.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

The desks and chairs from room 216 in Welles Hall were replaced with rolling chairs in Fall 2012.  The new chairs are on wheels, have a closed bottom for storage, a movable desktop, and a cup holder.  They are called spaceships because of the way students can zoom around the room in the bulky chairs.EOberdorf, 2012
