(adj) \shy-stee\ : Not good quality; (see shady). &quot;I don't want to deal with that kid. He's so Sheisty. And i heard he stole the tip cup once!&quot; Probably non-specific to Geneseo. A similar definition can be found on Urban Dictionary.[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sheisty] Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2001. (Dilluvio)Another synonym is sketchy, but the term 'sheisty' is possibly obsolete.Â
