While I agree that this term is not Geneseo specific and, perhaps, no longer &quot;hip&quot; to use in and of itself, &quot;Stylin'&quot; is by no means an obsolete term. I don't think that it's often (or ever) used in the same context as the definition's exemplified sentence because people don't refer to events as &quot;stylin'&quot;. People do, however, still use this word to describe objects (mostly clothing) and people. For instance, &quot;Jill is stylin'&quot; or &quot;Amber, those boots are stylin'!&quot; This term is not obsolete as of 2012. RMyers, S-Z, 2012
