(adj) 1. Tired, worn-out &quot;I'm not going to the bar, man... I'm spent.&quot; 2. no money left on meal plan. &quot;My silver plan is spent, so I'm going to Pizza Hut.&quot;A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spent; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.
