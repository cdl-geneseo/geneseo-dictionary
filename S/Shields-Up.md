Phrase created by Suny Geneseo to encourage students to wear their masks.&quot;We got another email telling us &quot;Shields up, knights!&quot;Edmond, S-Z, 2022

Comments:

A little less than half of the participants indicate never having heard this phrase, and most of the rest say not very often. (Edmond)
