n. Residence life staff from Seneca residence hall and Ontario residence hall.&quot;Scenario has the best programs.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

This was a phrase coined by the 2009-2010 Reslife staff of Seneca and Ontario. The two dorms have had the same Residence Director since Seneca was built in 2008. The student Reslife staff (two Assistant Resident Directors and many RAs) have worked closely together over the past several years. The hall councils often put on joint events and the dorms share several meeting spaces.It is not uncommon for two dorm to have a common RD, the entry &quot;Subtoga&quot; employs a similar combination, that of Saratoga and Steuben.RMyers, S-Z, 2012
