# Screw your roomate

Created by  Unknown User (arh11), last modified on Sep 28, 2008

Verb Phrase: To do anything which may affect your roomate in a negative way. &quot;John Screwed his roomate the other night when he left their door unlocked. The bandits made off with a ton of their stuff.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996.Dilluvio

Comments:

I don't think this phrase is used anymore or rather I don't think it is a defined phrase.  People mainly just use &quot;screw&quot; as slang.  The phrase itself seems to be based on that word rather than on the phrase itself. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z, 2012)
