# Sturges Quad

Created by  Unknown User (ejr7) on Nov 16, 2012

n. The land in front of the Sturges academic building.&quot;The Suess Spruce is in the Sturges Quad.&quot;EReck, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

Sturges Quad is a quadrangle enclosed by Sturges Hall, Fraser Hall, Blake Hall, and the back of the Erwin building.  It holds the Suess Spruce and the Paint tree. The use of an apostrophe after the final &quot;s&quot; in Sturges is debatable.  When referring to the quad between the back of Fraser, Welles, and South, it is normally called &quot;the South Hall Quad&quot; or &quot;Welles Quad.&quot;  It is not called &quot;South quad.&quot;  The lack of indication of a possessive is evident in the instance of &quot;The South Hall Quad&quot; but less obvious in either &quot;Sturges Quad&quot; or &quot;Welles Quad.&quot;EOberdorf, 2012
