A pathway between the center of campus and the South Side residence halls, especially the walkway cutting through the Saratoga Terrace buildings. Named for the intense wind gusts that whip through, often catching unprepared students off guard and scattering papers, umbrellas, and dignity alike. “I swear the Saratoga Wind Tunnel nearly took my whole backpack this morning.”

In a study done to determine if students knew the word about 50% of students did not know the word. The other 50% were familiar with the word, but only 41.7% could define the word.
