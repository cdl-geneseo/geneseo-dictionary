(adj)  1. Another term used to describe those who present more masculine and also identify as lesbian. This term is most often used to describe Black/ African-American and/ or Latina masculine lesbian/ queer women. Also known as “butch”.Example: &quot;Janelle Monáe has become a powerful voice for stud lesbians and other LGBTQ+ people who are fighting for visibility and acceptance.&quot; (Stewart, S-Z, 2023) 

Comments:

According to the surveys, 98% of the participants knew this term and 2% have never heard of this term. It is possible that some students here use this term on a day-to-day basis, but it should be known that it may not be commonly understood by others. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)

In past years, I have heard this applied to any sexually attractive male. Is that usage disappearing? If it has become limited to the definition posted above, then this would be an example of specialization. A future S-Z group might want to consider this.
