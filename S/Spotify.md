# Spotify

n. A digital music, podcast, and video streaming service that provides access to millions of songs and other content from creators around the world. “I’m listening to my Spotify summer playlist.” Of those served, no one was not familiar with Spotify, 7% were somewhat familiar with it, and a sizable 93% were very familiar with the word. (Smith, S-Z, 2024)
