\spnk\: 1. (v) To ejaculate 2. (nn) semen. &quot;Spunk is not fun to talk about.&quot;A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spunk; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.

Comments:

Could this word also be just that someone has &quot;spunk,&quot; meaning that he or she is kind of funky and energetic?
