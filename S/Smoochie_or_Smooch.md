Bibliographies and Study Guides : Smoochie or Smooch

Created by  Kayla Stewart on May 04, 2023

(adj) 1. New York City Slang; mostly used towards women in a derogatory manner– i.e. a woman who is known for having multiple partners. Example: &quot;Jessica is definitely a smoochie, she's slept around with half of the town.'&quot; (Stewart, S-Z, 2023) 

Comments:

According to the surveys, about 88% of participants knew of and understand this term and 5.9% of the participants have never heard of this term. It should be noted that this term is very popular in NYC so not many students at Geneseo use it on a daily basis. (Stewart, S-Z, 2023)
