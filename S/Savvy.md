\'sa-vE\ Fashionable vintage clothing store that opened on Main Street in Fall 2005. &quot;I bought my Rolling Stones t-shirt at Savvy.&quot; Submitted 2006. Dinki.Although the store still exists, no one listed the store under their knowledge of the word &quot;savvy&quot;. Most people said that it meant having a unique knowledge. &quot;Call CIT, they're really tech-savvy&quot;. Romig, S-Z, 2015.
