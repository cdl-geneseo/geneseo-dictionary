# Side Boob

Created by  Unknown User (lav4), last modified on Dec 01, 2008

Noun: What is seen when a topless woman (or very fat man) turn far enough to the side to see the breast, but not the nipple. Many movies, in order to keep a PG-13 rating, show only side boob. Braless women who wear sleeveless t-shirts are notorious for side boob.
