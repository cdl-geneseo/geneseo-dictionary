Refers to a stupid person, and alludes to their uneducatedness by calling their brain smooth - if the brain were wrinkled, that means you are having many deep, sophisticated thoughts.Â Example: &quot;Bruh, look at this smooth brain, he put the food in the microwave for half an hour because he thought it'd do the same thing as an oven.&quot;(Baranello, S-Z 2020)
