(n.) Abbreviation for Student Opinion of Faculty Instruction. Surveys taken anonymously by students at the end of the semester, evaulating the class and the teacher. Professors are given an average score of 0 to 5 and the results are published in the Lamron. &quot;What is this craziness? The SOFIs can be filled out online now!&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006 Dilluvio

Comments:

My friend from a school upstate asked me &quot;who is sofi?&quot; when looking at my email next to me, only confirming to me that this is a Geneseo specific term. Other schools do have surveys but at least to my knowledge they are called surveys or their own school specific term and not Student Opinion of Faculty Instruction. (LRumfola, S-Z 2012)
