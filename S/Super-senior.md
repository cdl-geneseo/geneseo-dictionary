Created by  Graham Drake, last modified on Jan 14, 2015

Super-senior: (noun) Anyone who has been in college for more than four years.  &quot;Word has it he's the longest-tenured super-senior here... he's been here since the 90s!&quot;  A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=super+senior; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.
