n. An item which was served in the Millennium Market in Letchworth dining hall while it was open. It consisted of a flour or wheat tortilla with various options for fillings and was toasted.&quot;I'm really annoyed with Atticus; he keeps complaining that spinners are no longer served on campus.&quot;EReck, S-Z, 2012Obsolete. Freeman 2015By this point, this word has become obsolete. Only juniors and seniors know that the word even exists because they are not found on campus at all anymore. The word is also not used.Â Savallo S-Z (2015)

Comments:

About 75% of those surveyed identified the correct definition of this word. This is an interesting situation currently because this item is not available on campus yet the recognition rate is still relatively high. In the coming years this word will probably become obsolete, but as of now it is recognizable but not generally used. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
