(n.) Short for Route 63. &quot;The fastest way to get across campus is to take Sixty-Three!&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006. Dilluvio.Obsolete. No one from our survey used &quot;sixty-three&quot; to refer to Route 63.  When we asked some of the students what that road actually was they just called it the road between the townhouses and Southside.  Romig, S-Z, 2015.
