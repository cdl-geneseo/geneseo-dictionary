--&gt; nickname for the parking lot located at the end of court street.&nbsp; Example "My car is all the way down at the sodomy lot" 

Comments:

About 10% of those surveyed correctly identified this term. There is the sense that this term can be applied to various outlying parking lots on campus and not just the one at the bottom of Court Street. This term has fallen out of general use and can be considered obsolete. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)
