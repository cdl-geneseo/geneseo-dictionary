(adj.) Creepy. &quot;The guy at the store was really sketchy. Standing near him made me uncomfortable.&quot; Pullano, S-Z, 2010.

Comments:

I would consider this word to be more specifically a Rochester term that has gained common use in Geneseo due to the high number of local students in attendance. (Craft, G-M, 2012)
