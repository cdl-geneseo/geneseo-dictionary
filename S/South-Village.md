Comments:

Our group had an interesting conversation concerning Southside/Northside and South Village/North Village. Both combinations are recognized on campus and students understand that they mean the same thing, but there is a strange discrepancy in the actual usage. I've never lived on Southside and have always called the campuses South- and Northside, but someone else (who has also never lived on the south campus) said that she primarily heard them called Villages. It would be interesting to survey the entire campus for this. I wonder if transfers generally refer to the campuses in one way? Or perhaps it goes by dorm? Do students who originally live in a given campus identify the others in any ubiquitous manner? The terms are all correct and one would be wrong to label either pair obsolete, but the involvement social identity is certainly interesting. RMyers, S-Z, 2012.
