NN Acronym for School of Performing Arts Latter consolidation of Geneseo's Departments of Dance, Music, and Theater; S95 but not known to all Geneseo Students. &quot;Brodie is the home of the SOPA.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 1996. Specific to Geneseo. Dilluvio

Comments:

This usage has mostly become obsolete among the majority of students.  The most common usage of this acronym is for the Stop Online Piracy Act that was a popular news subject in 2011 I believe.  It is possible that, given distance from that event, this form of the phrase can come back to popular usage.
