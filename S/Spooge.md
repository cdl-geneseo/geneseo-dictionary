# Spooge

Created by  Graham Drake, last modified on Jan 14, 2015

\ spu\: 1. (v) to ejaculate 2. (noun) semen. &quot;There's spooge all over his bed sheets.&quot; A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spooge; the entry is probably not specific to Geneseo.

Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2001.

Both words can be found on Urban Dictionary and both have the same definition. For whatever reason the slang term shifted ever so slightly to incorporate the &quot;l&quot; and this is what students most commonly use. I will second the entry's statement that this word is not Geneseo-specific, but I would also like to mention that, while this word is still heard and in use, I do not believe that it is the forerunner of seamen synonyms in Geneseo English.
