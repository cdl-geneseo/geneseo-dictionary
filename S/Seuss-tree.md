Dec 02, 2008Unknown User (tm7) The actual form of this word is Seuss Spruce.  I think there was some sort of decision made at some level of the group responsible for tours that tour guides would only use that form of it.  Also, it rolls off the tongue much more nicely. (Tim Moriarty, S-Z, 2012) Nov 19, 2012Also commonly referred to as the &quot;Seuss Spruce&quot; due to the flow of alliteration. 62% of those surveyed stated that during orientation they were introduced to the tree as the &quot;Seuss Spruce&quot; Bettina S-Z 2015.
