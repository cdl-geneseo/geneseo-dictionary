# Dictionary of Genseo English

The Dictionary of Geneseo English is a continuing project by students in ENGL 361, History of the English Language, at SUNY Geneseo, under the direction of Professor Graham Drake. Since the late 1980s, students in History of the English Language (and the now-defunct Structure of the English Language) have gathered data and updated a glossary of major colloquial/slang terms current among Geneseo students. The project began as a Wikimedia wiki in 2006, migrated to a Confluence wiki in 2008, and moved to its present location in Fall 2023.
