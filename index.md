# Dictionary of Geneseo English

The Dictionary of Geneseo English is an ongoing project by students in ENGL 361, History of the English Language, at SUNY Geneseo. It began in the early 1980s under the direction of Dr. Alan Lutkus and continues under the direction of Dr. Graham Drake. Students in History of the English Language (and the now-defunct course Structure of the English Language) gather data and update a glossary of major colloquial/slang terms current among Geneseo students. The project went online as a wiki in 2006 and moved to its present location in Fall 2024.

The current site will be updated periodically as students improve existing entries and create new ones.
