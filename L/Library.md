Libraryn. A place where books are stored and available for educational, research, and entertainment purposes. Geneseo’s library also included a research section for education majors that held videos and tangible objects. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 2020, McIntoshAs of 2020, 100% of students surveyed know the word. Of those surveyed, 0% believed it originated locally. While 100% believed it originated elsewhere.(McIntosh, G-M, 2020)

Comments:

I'm wondering whether a generic word such as Library (or Dormitory, or Classroom) really qualifies as a distinctively Geneseo word. &quot;Milne&quot; as a shortened title for Geneseo's library would seem more distinctive.
