adj. A contraction of 'legitimate.' Used as an adjective, this term means that something is real, actual, true, or certified. &quot;No, really, guys, this is legit - it's right here in The Lamron.&quot;adv. A contraction of 'legitimate'. Adverbially; &quot;It is legit cold outside.&quot;As of 2012, 100% of students surveyed knew this word and 5% believed it to be of local origin.(Eichas, G-M, 2012) 

Comments:

Technically, this isn't a contraction; it's a clip, i.e., a shortened version of a word.
