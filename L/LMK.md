LMKv. This is a phrase that means “let me know.” It’s typically used when plans are unclear and there will be future communication about them later once details are set, or if someone had forgotten to get back to one about plans that had been made.Use in a sentence, “Hey Shawn, if you’re still down to study together just lmk”.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 2020, McIntoshAs of 2020, 100% of students surveyed know the word. Of those surveyed, 0% believed it originated locally. While 100% believed it originated elsewhere.(McIntosh, G-M, 2020).

Comments:

This, and probably LMAO, would work well in text messages. It's interesting to think back to a time at Geneseo (in most of the 1990s, for instance) when people did not have personal cellphones. Email existed at Geneseo from the early 1990s, but I'm not sure the many acronyms/shorthand now common in text messages appeared in email.
