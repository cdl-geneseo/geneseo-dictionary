A small-framed person.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Fall 2006, Crane.As of 2012, 100% of students surveyed knew this word and 5% believed it to be of local origin.(Eichas, G-M, 2012) 

Comments:

Truthfully this should perhaps be revised into a new definition combining the two current separate ones, the implication of the term is most commonly that because a person is small-framed, they are easily intoxicated. (Craft, G-M, 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of students could define the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete. (B. Volpe, 2022)
