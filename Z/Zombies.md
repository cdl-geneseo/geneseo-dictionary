n. The antagonists from the Humans versus Zombies games.  &quot;Reuben wanted to start the game as a Zombie but wasn’t picked.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 2012

Comments:

The place of zombies in American culture has steadily become more evident, perhaps in relation to the notion that a &quot;zombie apocalypse&quot; is looming which can be connected to the idea that the world would end in 2012. Consequently, this word is not Geneseo-specific, but is prevalent in Geneseo culture, mainly because of the Humans Versus Zombies (HvZ) phenomenon. (EReck, S-Z, 2012)

Another possible use of the word could be to describe how a person feels when being extremely over tired. As in &quot;I pulled an all-nighter and now I feel zombie-fied&quot;
