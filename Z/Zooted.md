# Zooted

Created by  Anne Baranello, last modified on Dec 13, 2020

Used as an adjective to describe someone who is currently high off of marijuana. Used especially when someone has smoked enough to be mildly incoherent. Example: &quot;Dude, last night I got so zooted I could barely think. I thought the room was spinning.&quot; (Baranello, S-Z 2020)
