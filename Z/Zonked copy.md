# Zonked

adj. Has two different definitions, one being so extremely tired and another being knocked out by drugs and/or alcohol. SUNY Geneseo students often associated it with being passed out from partying or falling asleep when studying, with a synonym being bonked. Of those surveyed, 54% donâ€™t hear or use the word, 15% somewhat do, and 31% commonly do. (Smith, S-Z, 2024)
