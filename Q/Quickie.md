# Quickie

Created by  Unknown User (lav4), last modified on Oct 28, 2008

(n.) A brief session of something, e.g. drinking, x-box gaming, or sex. &quot;Let's go out to Kelly's for a quickie after class.&quot; Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/ ; entry probably not specific to Geneseo. Adams.

Comments:

There has been a certain amount of restriction in the usage of this word. Interviewed students uniformly associated it with sex, and said they would probably not use it in reference to anything else. (Wilcoxen, N-R, 2015).
