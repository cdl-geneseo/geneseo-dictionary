# Quarters

Created by  Unknown User (lav4), last modified on Oct 28, 2008

(n.) Drinking game in which one bounces quarters into a cup. My favorite drinking game is definitely quarters. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006. A similar definition appears at http://www.urbandictionary.com/ ; entry probably not specific to Geneseo. Adams.
