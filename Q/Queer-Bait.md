(n.) Heterosexual male who attracts male homosexuals. &quot;Tony was a hit at the party last night - he's a real queer bait.&quot; S92. Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English 2006. A similar definition found on http://www.urbandictionary.com ; entry probably not specific to Geneseo. Adams. (obsolete 2012).

Comments:

I personally have never heard of the noun &quot;Queer Bait&quot; but I think because of the phrase &quot;Jail Bait&quot; being so universally understood you can determine what &quot;Queer Bait&quot; means within context. (L.Rumfola, S-Z 2012).
