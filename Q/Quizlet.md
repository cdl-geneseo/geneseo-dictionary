Quizlet: (n.) website utilized by students for learning and studying vocabulary &amp; flashcards. &quot;I found my entire Chapter 6 Bio quiz on Quizlet last semester.&quot; As of 2022, &quot;Quizlet&quot; is very familiar with Geneseo students, averaging a score of 4.5 out of 5, with 1 representing a word unknown to Geneseo students and 5 representing a word used daily among students.Â J.
