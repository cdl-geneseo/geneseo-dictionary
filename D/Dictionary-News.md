Fall 2008 students in History of English are moving the Dictionary of Geneseo English from its original site on the old Collaborative Writing Project to the Geneseo wiki.

On November 15, the original CWP website at http://go.geneseo.edu/cwp will come down. While the move is taking place, Geneseo users can read the original dictionary here or download it here.

In addition, Fall 2008 students will be producing new dictionary entries and, at then end of the semester, filing reports on their work
