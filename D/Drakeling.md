# Drakeling

Created by  Unknown User (kec3), last modified on Nov 29, 2010

KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  Noun.  Term coined in our History of the English Language class for any student who purposely takes a class just because it is taught by Dr. Drake, no matter what time of day it is given.  

Comments:

6% (likely English majors) of those surveyed were familiar with and could define the term. Inherently Geneseo-specific. 2012

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not define the word; indicating that the word is obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
