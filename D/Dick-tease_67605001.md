# Dick-tease

Created by  Unknown User (ab21), last modified on Nov 16, 2010

Feminine Noun. Not as pejorative as a &quot;vamp.&quot; Term inspired from the verb &quot;to strip tease&quot; meaning that the girl turns the man on but has no intentions of concluding. She is only teasing. Same idea with here. Example: &quot;Don't lose your time with her, she's a dick-tease.&quot;
