Could this also be used as an equivalent of dime bag? Although I've never heard dime used as an attractive female, I've definitely heard it used in reference to a dime bag. (B. Joyce, 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
