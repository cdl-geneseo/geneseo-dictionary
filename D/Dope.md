1. AJ: Good looking; &quot;That chick is dope, man.&quot; S92 (Said to be Bronx NY term). 2. AJ: Cool; &quot;The party was dope--everyone was there.&quot; F92 AJ - Said to be falling out of use in the Fall of 1998, but majority of those surveyed in the Spring of 1999 cited hearing it often. Brognano, D. McGiveron

Comments:

In 2012, of the individuals we surveyed, more than 3/4 expressed familiarity with the term &quot;dope&quot;. However, of those individuals who expressed familiarity with the term &quot;dope&quot;, more than half defined &quot;dope&quot; as a name for marijuana or other drugs. The remainder provided definitions similar to the ones seen here. Some of the respondents who defined dope as a noun designating marijuana also provided the adjective &quot;cool&quot; as an alternate definition. None of the individuals surveyed believed that the definition of &quot;dope&quot; that they provided was specific to Geneseo.This word is still in use, but its definition should be updated.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
