# Dillhole

Created by  Unknown User (ms61) on May 08, 2015

An insult similar to &quot;dickhead&quot;

Comments:

Based on survey results, 87.5% of participants could not define the word; and 12.5% of participants indicated that the word sounds familiar. The world Dillhole is moderately obsolete and is rarely used around the Geneseo campus at this point in time (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).

20% of students who were surveyed have heard of this word and could define it. 8% of students who were surveyed had heard of this word but could not define it. 72% of students who were surveyed have never heard of this word and could not define it, thus this word is not longer relevant (Young, A-F, 2025).
