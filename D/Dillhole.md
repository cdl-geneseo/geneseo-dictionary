Created by  Unknown User (ms61) on May 08, 2015

An insult similar to &quot;dickhead&quot;

Comments:

Based on survey results, 87.5% of participants could not define the word; and 12.5% of participants indicated that the word sounds familiar. The world Dillhole is moderately obsolete and is rarely used around the Geneseo campus at this point in time (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
