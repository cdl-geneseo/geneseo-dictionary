KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  Noun.  A female person who acts as if she deserves special treatment, who is perhaps vocal and obnoxious about demanding it.  Coming into use for a male person who acts this way as well.

Of the students surveyed 100% knew and could define this word, thus it is still relevent (Greene, A-F, 2025).
