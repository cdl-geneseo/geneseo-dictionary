Dead Soldier: Noun- an empty beer can/bottle. 70% of people surveyed were familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008 

Comments:

In Fall of 2012, 1/6 of the people interviewed expressed familiarity with &quot;dead soldier&quot; and defined it in terms consistent with the 2008 definition. This usage of &quot;dead soldier&quot; is in decline.1/12 of respondents defined &quot;dead soldier&quot; as a male after ejaculating. None of the individuals that we surveyed believed that &quot;dead soldier&quot; had a unique Geneseo usage.
