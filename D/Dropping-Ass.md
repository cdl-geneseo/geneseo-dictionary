Bibliographies and Study Guides : Dropping Ass

Dropping Ass: Verb- A  violent bowel movement which typically occurs after a weekend of  bar food and beer, &quot;Don't go in the bathroom, I just dropped ass.&quot; 80% of people surveyed were familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008 

Comments:

Based on survey results, 50% of participants could define the word, and 50% of participants had no idea what it meant. This indicates that the word is not obsolete, but its usage is waning (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
