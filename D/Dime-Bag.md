Comments:

In 2012, more than 2/3 of the students we surveyed were familiar with this term and could both use it and understand its use in conversation. No one who was surveyed believed that this word  has usage specific to Geneseo.

Based on survey results, 25% of participants could define the word, while 75% of participants had no idea what the word meant; indicating that the word is moderately obsolete and it is rarely used around the Geneseo campus at this point in time (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
