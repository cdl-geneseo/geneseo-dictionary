DMB (NN): short for Dave Matthews Band. Definition of approximately 58% of those surveyed. (F06) (new word) Unknown by approximately 42% of those surveyed. (F06) Simmington Unknown by the faculty surveyed. Could have been unknown to students because it was an acronym. Simmington (F06)

Comments:

38%Â of those surveyed were familiar with the acronym and could definite it. Other participants were unable to expand the acronym. Inherently not Geneseo-specific. 2012

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could not define the word; indicating that the word is obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
