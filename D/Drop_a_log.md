VB: To move one's bowels. F94 VB - Obs. F98 Brognano, D. McGiveron

Comments:

50%Â of those surveyed were familiar with and could define the term, and the remaining 50% unfamiliar with the word could define it in context. Not Geneseo-specific. 2012

Based on survey results, 50% of participants had no idea what the word meant, 25% of participants could define it, and 25% of participants were familiar with the word. Over half of the participants could not recognize the word indicating that the word is not used often at this point in time, but it is not yet obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
