Deep Freeze for Cancer (NN): a charity event in which members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity camp out on the [[Sturges]] [[Quad]] for one week during the winter months. While attracting attention from students, they solicit donations for the National Cancer Society. 60% of those surveyed identified this word. (New word) (F06) LTiszenkel

Comments:

This page seems to be a typo- when surveyed participants wrote that they thought I had made a mistake on the survey, and asked if I meant the Deep Freeze for Cancer. There seems to be no option to delete the page, so, see &quot;Deep Freeze for Cancer.&quot;Â K. Andryshak, 2012

50% of those were familiar with this term but only guessed it because they assumed it was the Deep Freeze for Cancer. 50% of those surveyed were unfamiliar with either term. (Ali, A-F, 2019)
