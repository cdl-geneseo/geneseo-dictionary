Created by  Unknown User (kec3), last modified on Nov 29, 2010

KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  Noun.  Derogatory term for a girl who acts in an extremely flirty manner, as if she would like to have sex with a male, who then refuses him when he asks her.

Comments:

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word; indicating that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
