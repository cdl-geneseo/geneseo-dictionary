Created by  Zachary Arthur, last modified on Sep 23, 2008

NN-New way of pronouncing the word &quot;bitch.&quot; 

This entry was originally created by M. Gigante, 2006.

Comments:

A variant spelling I have also seen in print is &quot;beeyotch&quot;.  Possibly it represents a clarification of the vowel &quot;a&quot; in &quot;biatch&quot;, which might be taken by some to represent /'bi:æč/.  KKirkman, 24Nov08

Based on survey results, 80% of participants could define the word, while 20% of participants were familiar with the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).

When taking an in-person poll, 100% of the students asked knew the definition of the word, and then used it several times once the poll was over, indicating it is relevant and still fun to say. (Hastings, A-F, 2023)
