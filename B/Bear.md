Comments:

Slightly more than one quarter of the people we surveyed in Fall of 2012 defined &quot;bear&quot; as the bear statue referenced in the existing definition.Slightly less than 1/8 of the people we surveyed defined &quot;bear&quot; as a burly, gay male. This definition should be updated.

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
