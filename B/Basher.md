Comments:

42.8% knew this word, 14.3% had heard of it but were not completely sure what it meant, and 42.8% did not know it at all. These results indicate that the word is still in use at Geneseo, but maybe not as relevant as it once was (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

Based on survey results, 0% of participants could define this term with the associated 2012 definition. Instead a new definition was given with 28% of participants use the definition &quot;A person who 'bashes' other people views of beliefs&quot;. The 2012 definitions are both obsolete (S French, A-F, 2022).
