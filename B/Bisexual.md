Pronunciation: bī-ˈsek-sh(ə-)wəlAdj. Traditionally known as an individual with a sexual attraction to more than one gender. The traditional definition, however,  is regarded by many as exclusionary to other individuals of the LGBTQ+ community.  With a rise in LGBTQ+ awareness, this definition is constantly being challenged to better reflect a changing society.
