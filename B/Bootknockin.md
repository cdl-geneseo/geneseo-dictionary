Comments:

Only 1/7 of the people that we interviewed expressed familiarity with this term and defined it in terms consistent with the 2006 definition. Use of &quot;bootknockin'&quot; has declined significantly from the Fall of 2006 to the Fall of 2012.Â

Only 17% of people surveyed could define this word, while 50% did not know the word at all. This shows the word has become obsolete and no longer used for its original purpose. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
