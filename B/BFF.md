Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 88.2% of surveyors are familiar with the term, using the original 2001 definition. 58.2% of surveyors use this term as a Geneseo student, and 11.8% of surveyors believe the term is specific to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
