Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 100% of surveyors are familiar with this term. Only about 5.8% of surveyors use the original definition. About 64.7% of surveyors define booty as &quot;a butt&quot; or &quot;an ass&quot;. 29% of surveyors define the term as &quot;pirate treasure&quot;. About 82.4% of surveyors use the term as Geneseo students, and 5.8% of students believe the term is specific to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)
