Fecal matter.  Originally created 2006.Page creator: Unknown User (zma1)Date: Sep 18, 2008 14:37  Comments: Unknown User (mcc14) Unfortunately, no one that we interviewed in the Fall of 2012 expressed any familiarity with the term &quot;Belly Snake.&quot; It seems as though this word is dead. (sad) (M.Cordella, A-F, 2012)q Nov 20, 2012

Comments:

Based on survey results, 80% of participants could not define the word, and only 20% of participants were familiar with it. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete, but it is not used very much anymore (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
