Comments:

0% defined this correctly, although most believed that they knew the word. The general definition received was a request for aid in aspirating. This literal interpretation could merit a change in definition, although 0% claimed to use this word. (A-J 2012)

42.8% of those surveyed had heard of this word but were not completely sure what it meant, while 57.2% did not know it at all, thus indicating that the word is becoming less relevant at Geneseo (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

68% of the people surveyed are not familiar with this term at all. This suggests that the word is still in use by some people, but that its use is decreasing (Smith, A-F, 2022).
