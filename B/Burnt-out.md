adj., colloq.Pronunciation: Amer. / bərnt-æʊt 1. The state of being mental/physical/emotional exhaustion following a period of stress, a traumatic event, or a heavy marijuana usage. “By the end of finals week, I will be more than burnt-out.”J. Boselli, 2012

Comments:

75% of participants surveyed correctly identified this term. Survey results tended more towards the marijuana usage than other definitions, later classes may want to see how answers trend and reorder the definitions. K. Andryshak, 2012.

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: 90% of students were able to correctly identify this term. 100% of these participants related the term toward marijuana usage. It is relevant.

Future groups might want to inquire if an alternative spelling is &quot;burned out&quot;—and whether that reflects pronunciation, too.
