Breaking the Seal: Verb- The act of urinating for the first time while drinking. Once the seal is broken, restroom trips become much more frequent. 90% of people surveyed were familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008   2012, No change, still 90%. K. Andryshak

Comments:

50% of surveyed could define the term, while 17% did not know the term at all. &quot;Breaking the Seal&quot; is a term often used by individuals who are drinking alcohol, so that could explain the difference. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
