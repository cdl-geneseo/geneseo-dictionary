Created by  Zachary Arthur, last modified on Sep 23, 2008

AJ: Ridiculous; &quot;He wanted the paper by this Friday--that's so bogus.&quot; F92 AJ-falling out of use. Only 22% of the students surveyed identified this term. S99 AJ: 93% of students surveyed this term. F06 

This entry was originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

100% of the people we surveyed (Fall 2012) expressed familiarity with this term, but more than 3/4 of those people defined &quot;bogus&quot; as &quot;fake or fraudulent.&quot;The remaining 1/4 defined &quot;bogus&quot; consistent with the 2006 entry.This entry should be updated.

100% of the surveyed participants were familiar with the word and 3/4 of that group defined &quot;bogus&quot; in a similar fashion to the 2006 entry. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
