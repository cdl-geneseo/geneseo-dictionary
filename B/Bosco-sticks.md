Created by  Unknown User (jmb53) on Nov 19, 2012

n.Pronunciation: Amer. / bɒskəʊ-stɪk 1. Stuffed breadsticks sold at Southside Cafe, filled with a mozzarella cheese blend, occasionally with pepperoni. “Let’s go get some Bosco Sticks to eat.”J. Boselli, 2012

Comments:

In 2012, more than 3/4 of the people we surveyed were familiar with this usage of &quot;Bosco sticks.&quot; Of the respondents who were familiar with the D.O.G.E. definition, about half believed that this usage was specific to Geneseo.

83% of the people surveyed did not know what this word was, and only 17% was even familiar with it. This is due to the fact that Southside Cafe no longer exists, so the once popular snack is rarely mentioned in 2019. This word may be obsolete to Geneseo specifically, but is still widely known in other places. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
