/btrfes/ NN- A female with an attractive body, but an ugly face. Overheard at the In-Between September 14th, F02: &quot;That girl Sally has a nice figure, but her face looks like a dog. She is a real butterface.&quot; Originated from the sentences like &quot;She's got a real nice body, but her face needs work.&quot; HDAS, NDAS and OED turned up no matches or similar definitions. Lexis Nexis searches turned up only mentions of a band named Butterface and of the two words used individually, not pertaining to women in any way. BUT: No evidence given for capital beginning this item; derivation is highly entertaining, but needs some evidence (otherwise, it is no more convincing than sometimes heard derivations like &quot;sirloin&quot; coming from a king so happy with his dinner that he dubbed it &quot;Sir Loin&quot;: that derivation simply isn't true)

Comments:

This term may have resulted from a combining of words. e.g. &quot;That girl has got a really great body... but her face.&quot;But her face = butterface(Cecchini, A-F, 2012)
