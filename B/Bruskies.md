NN: Beer. F92 87% of surveyed students identified this term as refering to beer.

Fall 2008- 100% of those surveyed were able to correctly define the term. 90% claimed to not use the term. Term seems to be falling out of use.

This entry was originally created by D McGiverson, 2006.

Comments:

The hypothesis of the 2008 group seems to have been correct. According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, only 29% of surveyors are familiar with the term, using the original 2006 definition. Only 50% of students familiar with the term use it as Geneseo students, and 0% believe the term is used specifically in Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)Â
