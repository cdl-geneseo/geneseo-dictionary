# Bailey

KChapman and ABelliard, 2010:  Bailey Hall, older science building located along the North side of College Green.

Comments:

Slightly less than half of the people we interviewed (Fall 2012) defined Bailey as the old, unused science building on the north side of the College Green. Slightly less than 1/8 of our respondents identified Bailey with Bailey's Irish Creme, an alcoholic beverage. This entry should be updated.

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
