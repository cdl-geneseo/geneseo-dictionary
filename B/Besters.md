NN: Clipped form with derivational suffix of beer, &quot;Milwaukee's Best&quot;; &quot;I'm gonna run up to Rite Aid later on and pick me up a twelve of besters for $2.99.&quot; (undated but before F92) NN-Obs. F92

Comments:

No one that we interviewed (Fall 2012) provided this definition of &quot;besters.&quot; This is a dead definition.Â Less than 1/5 of the people we interviewed defined &quot;besters&quot; as a really annoying way to refer to best friends.This definition should be updated.
