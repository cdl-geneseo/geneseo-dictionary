Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 58.8% of students were familiar with this term; however, 10% of those surveyors used a different definition than the 2008 definition, describing the term as &quot;a sound a ball makes when bouncing off another object&quot;. 35,3% of surveyors use the term as Geneseo students, and 0% of students believe that the term is specific to Geneseo college life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

83% of the surveyed people were familiar with the word but could not clearly define the word. Definitions varied, yet similar to the aforementioned definitions. However, the lack of consistency shows that this word may become obsolete in the next few years.
