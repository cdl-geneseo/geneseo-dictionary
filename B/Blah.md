blah NN: a general feeling mood of listlessness or dullness. 90% of students survyed use this word F06. 

This entry was originally created by K. Tousey, 2006.

Comments:

More than 90% of the students we surveyed (Fall 2012) were familiar with this term, and defined it similarly to the Geneseo Dictionary definition. None of them thought that &quot;blah&quot; had a unique, Geneseo usage.

Based on survey results, 60% of participants could define the word and 40% of participants were familiar with the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
