Interjection- variation of bullshit.  New term Fall 2008

This entry originally created by T Cardot, 2008.

Comments:

I have heard and understand the interjection &quot;bullshit&quot;, but I have never heard of the interjection &quot;Bullcunt&quot;- however I have heard &quot;Bullfuck&quot;. I also believe that none of these terms are Geneseo specific but are understood however no matter what follows &quot;Bull-&quot;. (LRumfola, S-Z 2012)

No one that we surveyed expressed familiarity with this term (Fall 2012). Obsolete.

J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: This term, unlike the variation, is completely obsolete. This word is likely dead.
