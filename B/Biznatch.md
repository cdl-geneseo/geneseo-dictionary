AJ- new word meaning something gross. S99J.Boselli, 2012: n. 1. An non-expletive alternative to &quot;bitch.&quot; Considered to be relatively euphemistic.  75% of those surveyed were familiar with and could define the term, but not in adjective sense of the word. 

This entry was originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

Based on survey results, 20% of participants were familiar with the word, while 80% of participants had no idea what the word meant. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete, but it is not used very much anymore (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
