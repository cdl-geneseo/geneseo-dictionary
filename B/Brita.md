Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, about 82.4% of surveyors are familiar with this term. 50% of students familiar with the term use the original 2002 definition, while the other 50% define the term similarly, but also indicating that Brita is a &quot;specific brand&quot; or &quot;certain brand&quot; of water filter.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

83% of surveyed identified this word to mean the specific brand of water filters. It is commonly used among students who live on campus, as it provides easy access to filtered water.
