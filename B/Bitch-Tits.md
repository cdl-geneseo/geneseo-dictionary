Admittedly, this term does not seem to be in use very much anymore.Â (Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

I actually hear this term very frequently (mainly in the adjectival sense) so I do not think it is obsolete. (Montelli, N-R, 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
