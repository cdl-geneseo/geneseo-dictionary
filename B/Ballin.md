This term does not have to necessarily refer to basketball, but it was well known and used to describe something cool or successful. (Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

100% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

50% of the people who were surveyed know what this word means. The majority believe that the word is used to describe something cool or successful, while a smaller amount of people believe that it means &quot;good at basketball&quot; or &quot;someone who is flaunting their wealth.&quot; This indicates that the word can be used to mean all three of these definitions, but that it is most often used to describe something cool or successful (Smith, A-F, 2022).
