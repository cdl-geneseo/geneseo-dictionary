(bi:n-r) n. A racist term for a person of Hispanic descent. F06

This entry was originally created by J. Brognano, 2006.

Comments:

One third of the people surveyed in the Fall of 2012 expressed familiarity with this term, and identified it as a racial slur directed at Hispanics. Surprisingly, 2/3 of the people we interviewed had not heard this term and could not provide a definition. It seems as though this word is in decline.

25% knew this word while 75% did not know it at all, indicating that its usage is significantly decreasing (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).
