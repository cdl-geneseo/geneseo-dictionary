Comments:

Exactly half of the people we surveyed (Fall 2012) expressed familiarity with this term.When it came to defining &quot;birthday mug,&quot; there's some disagreement between our respondents about whether it refers to a mug from the Vital or from Kelly's. Our respondents were split. Kelly's, however, does not currently offer birthday mugs. Interestingly, one of our respondents claimed that Professor Mary Gillin gives out birthday mugs.

Based on survey results, 20% of participants could define the word, while 80% of participants had no idea what the word meant. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete, but it is not used very much anymore (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
