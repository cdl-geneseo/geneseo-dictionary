This entry was originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 100% of surveyors are familiar with this term! AND, 100% of students coined the term as meaning awesome or cool, which is the original 2006 definition. It is interesting how McGiveron claims that (in 2006) the term is falling out of use; however, 100% of the population surveyed in 2012 are familiar with the word, and use the original 2006 definition in the Geneseo dictionary project. 52.9% of surveyors use the word as Geneseo students, but only 5.9% of surveyors see the term as specific to Geneseo life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
