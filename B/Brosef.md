Comments:

Slightly less than 3/4 of the people that we surveyed (Fall 2012) knew this term and defined it consistent with the 2008 definition. The common use of &quot;brosef&quot; seems to be in decline.

67% of the surveyed use the word on a daily basis, while the other 33% were at least familiar with it. The use of the word will depend on if the 67% rate remains or increases in the future. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
