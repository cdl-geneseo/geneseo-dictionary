Created by  Zachary Arthur, last modified on Nov 24, 2008

NN A person from Long Island who thinks he is the man and says &quot;bro&quot; to everyone; &quot;Oh my God that guy is such a bro.&quot;

100% of people surveyed knew this term.

Comments:

I think the definition of &quot;bro&quot; is more complicated than that, but I think I would be hard-pressed to define it myself. I think implicit in &quot;bro&quot; is the idea of a guy who isn't quite a jock (almost there) and may have some interests generally not associated with that &quot;type.&quot; Also, I've noticed that bros tend to be far more comfortable with other guys (namely bros...) than your typical gentlemen. The full scope of &quot;bro&quot; is probably best understood by...well, being from Long Island.
