Created by  Unknown User (tjc13), last modified on Nov 24, 2008

noun- term used in reference to &quot;The Blackface Incident&quot; of the Fall 2007 academic semester which brought attention to structural inequalities regarding race on the Geneseo campus.  The incident was sparked when three white students dressed up for Halloween as black rappers, including black face paint.

Comments:

Only one participant identified this term in connection with the Geneseo incident of 2007, rendering the term in connection with Geneseo almost obsolete. K. Andryshak, 2012

Based on survey results, 80% of participants could define the word and 20% of participants were familiar with the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
