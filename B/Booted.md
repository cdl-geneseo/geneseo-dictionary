This entry was originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

2/3 of the people we surveyed (Fall 2012) expressed familiarity with this word.When asked to define &quot;booted,&quot; none of the respondents provided a definition consistent with &quot;heavily intoxicated,&quot; although half of respondents believed that it referred to vomiting from drinking. The other half of respondents considered &quot;booted&quot; to refer to being kicked off of a server, or removed by a moderator from an internet thread. This entry should be updated to reflect this new definition.

100% of people surveyed defined this word in the same way as the given definitions. It should be noted that this can also be used as a past tense verb of boot, especially relating to the act of vomiting. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
