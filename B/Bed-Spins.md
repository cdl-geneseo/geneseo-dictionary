Comments:

This definition is widely accepted, but it is likely that the 'bed' part is obsolete. People generally understood or could infer what &quot;the spins&quot; might refer to.(Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

Based on survey results, 40%Â of participants could define the word, 40% of participants were familiar with it, and 20% of participants had no idea what the word meant. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete, but it is not used very much anymore (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
