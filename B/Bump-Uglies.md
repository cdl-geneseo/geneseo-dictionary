Bump uglies: Verb- To have sex. &quot;Me and my girl are gonna bump uglies tonight.&quot; 83% of people surveyed were familiar with this term. BIervese, 2008  

Comments:

According to my group's survery thus far, 20% of surveyors are familiar with this term. 100% of those familiar with the term use the original definition. 25% of those familiar with the term, however, add onto the definition: &quot;to have sex- with an unattractive person&quot;. 0% of surveyors use this term as college students, and 0% believe the term is specific to Geneseo life.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)
