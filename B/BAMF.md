None of those surveyed knew what this word meant, rendering it obsolete (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

85.7% knew the meaning of this word, or rather what the acronym stood for, but 28.6% said the word was cringe and should stopped being used. This indicates that the word is not yet obsolete, but many think it should be. (Hastings, A-F, 2023)
