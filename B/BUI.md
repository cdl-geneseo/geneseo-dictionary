BUI - Acronym Biking Under the Influence. When you get drunk and try to ride a bike. &quot;Careful, you don't wanna get a BUI tonight.&quot; 73% of people surveyed were familair with this term. BIervese, 2008  J. Bloom, A-F, 2019: This term has gone obsolete. 

Comments:

Less than 10% of the people we surveyed claimed to know this term, and only 3% are able to define it, consistent with the 2008 entry. Over the past four years, familiarity with &quot;BUI&quot; decreased 70%. This word is critically endangered.
