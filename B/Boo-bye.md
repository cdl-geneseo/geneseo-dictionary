Comments:

67% of the surveyed were familiar with the word, 33% had never heard of it. This shows the word is quickly losing relevance, at least on this campus.

Based on survey results 22% of participants could identify the term, with the 2012 definition. It was also referred to as just a shorter version of saying goodbye (S French, A-F 2022).
