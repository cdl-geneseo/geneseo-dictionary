Bibliographies and Study Guides : Bomb Diggity

AJ: Really Cool. Identified by 80% of those surveyed. F06 

This entry was originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

67% of the surveyed people defined the word as &quot;really cool,&quot; which is an adjective that can be applied to almost any situation. &quot;Diggity&quot; itself is not a word, so this phrase would primarily be used in a casual setting.

By saying that &quot;diggity&quot; is not a word, do you mean that it is a bound morpheme? If so, why is it separated from the word &quot;bomb&quot;?
