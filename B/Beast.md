Bibliographies and Study Guides : Beast

Created by  Zachary Arthur, last modified on Sep 18, 2008

NN: Milwakee's Best; &quot;This beer sucks. It must not be the beast.&quot; F92 NN-46% of the students surveyed identified this term as Milwaukee's Best. 

This entry was originally created by M. Gigante and D. McGiveron, 2006.

Comments:

Maybe this is regional, but on Long Island, &quot;beast&quot; is frequently used (largely in sports circles) to refer to a game, maneuver, etc. that is particularly energetic, impressive, or even aggressive. &quot;To beast&quot; also means to do something well, energetically, impressively, etc. I find it particularly amusing when it manages to escape the sports sphere (&quot;I totally beasted that beer pong game!&quot;) or when women use it. Does anyone else hear this usage?

Based on survey results, 80%Â of participants could define the word, and 20% of participants had no idea what the word meant. This indicates that the word is not obsolete, however, some participants were not able to identify its meaning. (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
