25% of participants identified this word as vomiting/throwing up. Most simply defined it as a specific type of shoe worn on the foot. None identified it in regards to definition given above as a noun, rendering that meaning obsolete.Â K. Andryshak, 2012

100% of the people surveyed could define it, using only the synonym for vomit or the clothing article as the definition. The noun provided in the original definition was not provided by participants, so that definition remains obsolete. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
