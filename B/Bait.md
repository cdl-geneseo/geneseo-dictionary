This entry was originally created by M. Gigante, 2006.

Comments:

According to the surveys that have been completed thus far in my group, 82.4% surveyors are familiar with this term. 100% of surveyors who are familiar with this term define the term as a noun: &quot;An object used to lure in another object&quot;. 58.8% of the surveyors use this term as a Geneseo student. It is interesting to see how the original term has changed. It is also curious as to why the surveyors use this term specifically as a Geneseo college student.(Birkby, A-F, 2012)

50% of those surveyed knew this word while the other 50% had heard of it but were not completely sure what it means in this context, thus indicating that it is still relevant, but maybe not used as often in Geneseo (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

100% of students asked knew this word but with a different definition entirely, indicating this word is now obsolete and only used to mean &quot;an object meant to lure in something else&quot;. (Hastings, A-F, 2023)
