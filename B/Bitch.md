/b/ VB- do something disappointing. One friend to another after third friend had left the bar with his girlfriend: &quot;Yeah, he definitely bitched.&quot; F02; OED: V: To behave bitchily towards a person: &quot;She'd been bitched by everyone else so that she wouldn't be surprised to have me leaver her there in the rain.&quot;

Comments:

A very frequent sense of the verb is &quot;to complain&quot;, as in &quot;Stop bitching about being tired and go to class already!&quot;

Interestingly, none of our respondents defined &quot;bitch&quot; as a verb. Rather, more than 4/5 of the people we interviewed (Fall 2012) defined &quot;bitch&quot; as a noun: (1) &quot;an obscene pejorative term for a female&quot; and (2) &quot;a male who is perceived as weak&quot;. This definition should be updated.

Based on survey results, 100% of participants could define the word. These results indicated that the word is not obsolete (M Gillanders, A-F, 2019).
