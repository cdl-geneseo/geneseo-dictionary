Comments:

42.8% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means while 57.2% had heard of it but were not completely sure what it meant, thus indicating that it is still relevant, but might not be used by that many people regularly at Geneseo (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).Â

51% of the people surveyed are familiar with this word, with the majority believing that its definition is &quot;dismissal of something, similar to 'whatever.'&quot; This indicates that the word is still in use and that its definition has not changed. (Smith, A-F, 2022).
