Bibliographies and Study Guides : Break out

VB: To leave a place or situation; &quot;I want to go home--let's break out.&quot; In OED in this sense. S96 VB-64% of the students surveyed identified this term as the growth of pimples.

Fall 2008- 100% of students surveyed were able to identify this term in these contexts.  However, students surveyed claimed to use this term infrequently, term appears to be falling out of use.

This entry originally created by D. McGiveron, 2006. 

Comments:

More than 3/4 of the students surveyed could use and define this term in a manner consistent with the D.O.G.E., but none of them thought that their usage of &quot;break out&quot; was specific to Geneseo. This phrase seems stable, from 2008.

100% of students surveyed defined this term most consistent with health, i.e. &quot;breaking out&quot; in acne. (Serbalik, A-F, 2019)
