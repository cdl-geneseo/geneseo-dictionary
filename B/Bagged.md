Comments:

71.4% of the people that were surveyed by my group knew what this word means, while 28.5% had heard of it but were not sure what it meant, thus it is still relevant (Nicchi, A-F, 2019).

To have sex with; "Bill bagged Jill after the party." 80% of people surveyed knew this term and could define it, 20% knew the word but could not define it. Thus it is still a relevent term (Greene, A-F,2025).
