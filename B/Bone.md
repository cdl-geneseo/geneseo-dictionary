Comments:

The most widely accepted definition is the second, meaning to have sex with someone.(Cecchini, A-F, 2012)

Is this word gendered–i.e., can it refer to what (dominant) males do in sex, or does it just mean &quot;to have sex&quot;? Can the verb be both transitive (taking a direct object) and intransitive (taking no object)?
