(verb) To relax to the point of appearing to be a &quot;vegetable&quot; (dull spiritless person); to relax.

Comments:

Responses were evenly distributed from never hearing it to using it daily. This range likely reflects how there are multi speech communities on campus and different social circles have continued to use it while others have not. (H. Heckman, S-Z, 2022).
