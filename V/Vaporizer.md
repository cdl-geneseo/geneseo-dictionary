(N) - A device that super-heats Marijuana into vapor, both increasing and preserving higher than ordinary levels of the hallucinogen THC. Smoked much like a hookah.

VanHarken, S-Z, 2010

Comments:

I find it interesting that this is defined as being &quot;smoked much like a hookah.&quot; In what way? A hookah burns a coal on top of a bowl of tobacco which is smoked through a hose whereas a vaporizer is smoked out of a plastic bag that fills with marijuana vapor. I find that, defined as such, a vaporizer can be just a similar to a bong or any other smoking device. (B. Joyce, 2012)
