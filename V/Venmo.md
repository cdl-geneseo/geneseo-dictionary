# Venmo

Created by  Unknown User (clc18), last modified on Apr 01, 2019

(noun): A smartphone application that allows people to charge or send money to other people. Since many Geneseo students do not regularly carry around cash, they use the application to fairly exchange money for goods and services. Out of 144 Geneseo students who participated in our group's word survey, 131 of them knew this word.  “Is it okay if I pay you for the U-Hots through Venmo since I do not have any money on me?”Clare Corbett, Group S-Z, 2019
