# Very Mindful, Very Demure

Phrase. To be extremely modest, reserved, and considerate of others, essentially acting in a polite and respectful manner. Circling on TikTok and originating from creator Jools Lebron, known by some as brain rot and by others a very cutesy girlhood term. Of SUNY Geneseo co-ed students surveyed, 8% were not familiar with the saying, 38% were somewhat familiar with it, and 54% were very familiar with it. (Smith, S-Z, 2024)
