n. Non-meat alternatives to chicken nuggets.  Were revealed to be non-vegan Fall 2012.&quot;All the Vegans are angry because CAS provided misinformation about the Vegan nuggets.&quot;EOberdorf, S-Z, 201220/32 people within the survey were familiar with what &quot;vegan nuggets&quot; are, but are more familiar with the term &quot;Garden Nugget.&quot; This is due to the change in menu name at Southside Cafe in 2013.

Comments:

On October 18, 2012 a post was made to the Geneseo CAS facebook page about the non-vegan ingredients in &quot;vegan&quot; nuggets.  The nuggets are from Morningstar Farms and while they were originally vegan they now contain milk and eggs.  These nuggets became vegetarian in 2011 but CAS continued to label them as vegan until fall 2012.  CAS responded to criticism over the incident by stating they were working on a better method of labeling for dietary restrictions.Edit: The vegan nuggets were not vegan as far back as 2009.  It is also being argued that they have not been vegan since 1998.EOberdorf, 2012
