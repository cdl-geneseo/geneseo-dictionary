# Vine

Created by  Unknown User (mtr7), last modified by  Jack Katz on May 07, 2022

Phone app that allows people to take 7 second videos of themselves.  Has become a sort of challenge between people to try and make the best video that they can in 7 seconds.  This is something that is used around the world, but students felt that it was important to include it in the dictionary.  Commonly used in the expression &quot;do it for the vine&quot;.  &quot;That was a crazy stunt that he pulled, but he did it for the vine&quot;.  Romig, S-Z, 2015.

Comments:

Even though Vine shutdown in 2017 usage is still high among respondents with only 3% reporting that they have never heard it at all and 29% reporting that they still use the word everyday. (Katz, S-Z, 2022)
