Some people (mainly modern gamers) were aware of VAX, but no longer refer to it in conversation.Source: Geneseo Dictionary 2006. Nicodemi. This term remains obsolete on the Geneseo campus. This could be due to the fact that the company stopped manufacturing the computers in 2005. Only one student out of 97 had heard of the word before.   Clare Corbett, Group S-Z, 2019
