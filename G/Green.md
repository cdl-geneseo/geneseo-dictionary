Comments:

This is a term that in surveying of Geneseo and non-Geneseo students received definitions related to the Green movement, although not enough to warrant an update to the entry.  However, it will be interesting to see if this trend continues over time and if &quot;Green&quot; becomes solely associated with the social movement. (S.
