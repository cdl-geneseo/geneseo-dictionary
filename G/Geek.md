''Noun'' Non-traditional (older) college student, highly motivated to succeed, willing to engage instructors in challenging questions; &quot;Mom, you're such a ''geek''.&quot; Results: 27.5% of those surveyed knew this word, and 100% of the people that kenw the word, did not learn it at Geneseo. Also, a significant number of people (all of them) claimed to know this word before they were given the defintion. This means that 72.5% of those surveyed recognized the word, but did not agree with the definition (since their personal definitions did not coincide with the Geneseo definition as given above, these people were said to not know the word.) Conclusion: The word is not local to Geneseo and the word is more commonly associated with other definitions.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1999 - Kocher46% of students surveyed knew this word, and 10% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo. This word is not a commonly used word. Upon talking to many of the students who participated in our survey, they did not know the term with the definition given by the previous years.(Klein, E-H, 2008)As of 2012, 98% of students surveyed know this word and 0% believe it is of local origins. The survey results also support prior comments that this word is associated with more general, non-college specific definitions.(Fischer, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

A survey of non-Geneseo students indicated that the new definition for &quot;Geek&quot; is in fact common amongst other college communities. (S. Fischer, November 20, 2012)
