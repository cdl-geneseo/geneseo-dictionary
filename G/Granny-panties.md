Conclusion: This word is widely known but not specific to Geneseo.-C Adam82% of students surveyed knew this word, and 0% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo. Although a large percentage of students knew this word, no students learned the term in Geneseo.(Klein, E-H, 2008)As of 2012, 80% of students surveyed know of this word, of which 0% believe it to be of local origin.(Fischer, G-M, 2012)

Comments:

A survey of non-Geneseo students showed that this was a term that was not unique to Geneseo and was, in fact, very common to college life in general.
