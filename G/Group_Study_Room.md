# Group Study Room

The Group Study Room is a place where students can reserve a room to study by themselves or with other people. According to my findings 100% of students claimed they knew of this term. 44% of students thought that this word originated from Geneseo. 56% of people thought that this word did not originate from Geneseo.  (Stout Peters, G-M 2025)
