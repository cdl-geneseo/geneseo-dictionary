Comments:

This is one of the oddest entries, in that it is highly understandable in a non-college setting.  Further suggestion of this comes from a majority of non-Geneseo students responding with this definition on a survey, even though they were not prompted to think of it from a college perspective. (S. Fischer, November 20, 2012)
