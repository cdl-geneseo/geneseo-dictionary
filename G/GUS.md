''Noun'' The CAS owned convenience store on University Drive - an acronym for &quot;Geneseo University Store.&quot;; &quot;Let's go to ''GUS'' and buy some subs and something to drink.&quot; Results: This is a new word to the Geneseo Dictionary since the store was opened in the Fall of '98. Twenty people surveyed, and 40% of them knew the word but 63% ofo these people needed assistance in the form of a sentence or definition. Conclusion: This word is local to Geneseo and its use is very limited.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1999 - KocherOf those surveyed in 2008, 70.5% knew the word, and of those, 93.5% learned it in Geneseo.Talbot, 2008Â As of 2012, 10% of students surveyed knew this word, 10% believed it is of local origin.(Felice, G-M, 2012)As of 2015 0% of Geneseo students surveyed were familiar with the term. Of those surveyed 0% believed it to be of local origin.(Sigl, G-M, 2015)

Comments:

I think it's important to note that since GUS was replaced by Fusion Market last year, this term can be expected to fall out of use within the next few years.
