Goober - n. A term of endearment used to describe a goofy, dorky, but well intentioned individual. A “goober” may be the butt of a joke, but the joke’s intent is never malicious.“Look at John dancing by himself in the middle of the party. That kid is such a goober!”As of 2015, 83% of students surveyed know this word. 2% believe it is of local origins.(Powell, G-L, 2015)
