''Noun'' Acronym for God-damned independent, one not belonging to a sorority or fraternity; &quot;Me pledge? No, I'm a ''GDI''.&quot; Results: 5% of those surveyed knew this word, and 100% of the people that knew the word, learned the word at Geneseo. Conclusion: This word is probably local to Geneseo and very limited in use.Source: Dictionary of Geneseo English, Spring 1999 - Kocher30% of students surveyed knew this word, and 0% of these students had learned the word at Geneseo. I would argue that our survey group was perhaps not as representative of the Greek community as it should have been. The knowledge of this word may be higher among students in Fraternities or Sororities.(Klein, E-H, 2008)As of 2010, 0% of those surveyed knew the word. This word appears to be obsolete(Fishkin, G-M, 2010)As of 2012, 0% of students surveyed know this word and 0% believe it is of local origins. Either this word is not known among the students surveyed, or is out of use. The data is inconclusive.(Fischer, G-M, 2012)As of 2019, 26.3% of Geneseo student surveyed know this word. 0% believe it is of local origins. (Banaszak, G-M, 2019)
